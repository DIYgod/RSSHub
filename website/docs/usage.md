# Getting Started

## Generate an RSS Feed

To subscribe to a Twitter user's timeline, first look at the route document of [Twitter User Timeline](/routes/social-media#twitter-user-timeline).

`/twitter/user/:id` is the route where `:id` is the actual Twitter username you need to replace. For instance, `/twitter/user/DIYgod` with a prefix domain name will give you the timeline of Twitter user DIYgod.

The demo instance will generate an RSS feed at <https://rsshub.app/twitter/user/DIYgod>, use your own domain name when applicable. This feed should work with all RSS readers conforming to the RSS Standard.

You can replace the domain name `https://rsshub.app` with your [self-hosted instance](/install).

RSSHub supports additional parameters such as content filtering and full-text extraction, refer to [Parameters](/parameter) for details.

## Contribute a New Route
