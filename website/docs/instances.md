# Public Instances

Although the official instances are already stable enough, in order to achieve decentralization, we encourage users to host their own RSSHub instances or use other public RSSHub instances.

If you are willing to contribute your own instance for others to use, please edit [this file](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/tree/master/website/src/components/InstanceList.tsx) and submit a PR to add your instance to the list.
