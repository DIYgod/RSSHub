# Deployment

RSSHub provides a painless deployment process if you are equipped with basic programming knowledge, you may open an [issue](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues/new/choose) if you believe you have encountered a problem not listed [here](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues), the community will try to sort it out asap.

The deployment may involve the followings:

1.  Command line interface
2.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3.  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
4.  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/zh-Hans/docs/install)

Deploy for public access may require:

1.  [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)
2.  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3.  [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
4.  [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
5.  [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
6.  [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)
7.  [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com)

## Docker Image

We recommend using the latest version `diygod/rsshub` (i.e. `diygod/rsshub:latest`) of the docker image.

When the latest version is unstable, you can use the image with a date tag for temporary use. For example:

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub:2021-06-18
```

You can back to the latest version when the code has been fixed and rebuild the image.

To enable puppeteer, `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` is a good choice. If date specified, it will become: `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled-2021-06-18`.

Another approach to enable puppeteer is deploying with Docker Compose. However, it consumes more disk space and memory. By modifying `docker-compose.yml`, you can use `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` instead to reduce the disk space and memory consumption.

## Docker Compose Deployment

### Install

Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Check if any configuration needs to be changed

```bash
$ vi docker-compose.yml  # or your favorite editor
```

Create a docker volume to persist Redis caches

```bash
$ docker volume create redis-data
```

Launch

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Update

Remove old containers

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

Repull the latest image if you have downloaded the image before. It is helpful to resolve some issues.

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Configuration

Edit `environment` in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

## Docker Deployment

:::tip

To enable puppeteer, replace `diygod/rsshub` with `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` in **EACH** command.

:::

### Install

Execute the following command to pull RSSHub's docker image.

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub
```

Start an RSSHub container

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rsshub -p 1200:1200 diygod/rsshub
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1200](http://127.0.0.1:1200), and enjoy it! ✅

Execute the following command to stop `RSSHub`.

```bash
$ docker stop rsshub
```

### Update

Remove the old container

```bash
$ docker stop rsshub
$ docker rm rsshub
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Configuration

The simplest way to configure RSSHub container is via system environment variables.

For example, adding `-e CACHE_EXPIRE=3600` will set the cache time to 1 hour.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rsshub -p 1200:1200 -e CACHE_EXPIRE=3600 -e GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=example diygod/rsshub
```

This deployment method does not include puppeteer (unless using `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` instead) and Redis dependencies. Use the Docker Compose deployment method or deploy external dependencies yourself if you need it.

To configure more options please refer to [Configuration](#configuration).

### Configuration

:::tip

On arm/arm64, this deployment method does not include puppeteer dependencies. To enable puppeteer, install Chromium from your distribution repositories first, then set `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to its executable path.

Debian:

```bash
$ apt install chromium
$ echo >> .env
$ echo 'CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=chromium' >> .env
```

Ubuntu/Raspbian:

```bash
$ apt install chromium-browser
$ echo >> .env
$ echo 'CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=chromium-browser' >> .env
```

:::

RSSHub can be configured by setting environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`. For example:

```
CACHE_TYPE=redis
CACHE_EXPIRE=600
```

Please notice that it will not override already existed environment variables, more rules please refer to [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

This deployment method does not include Redis dependencies. Use the Docker Compose deployment method or deploy external dependencies yourself if you need it.

To configure more options please refer to [Configuration](#configuration).

### Update

Under `RSSHub`'s directory, execute the following commands to pull the latest source code for `RSSHub`

```bash
$ git pull
```

Then repeat the installation steps.

### A tip for Nix users

## Deploy to Fly.io

### Method 1: Fork

1.  [Fork RSSHub](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/fork) to your GitHub account;
2.  Clone the source code from your fork

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/<your username>/RSSHub.git
    $ cd RSSHub
    ```

3.  [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up) and install the [flyctl CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/);
4.  Run `fly launch` and choose a unique name and region to deploy;
5.  Use `fly secrets set KEY=VALUE` to [configure some modules](#configuration-route-specific-configurations);
6.  [Set up automatic deployment via GitHub Actions](https://fly.io/docs/app-guides/continuous-deployment-with-github-actions/);
7.  (Optional) Use `fly certs add your domain` to configure a custom domain, and follow the instructions to configure the related domain resolution at your DNS service provider (you can check the domain configuration status on the Dashboard Certificate page).

Upgrade: On the homepage of your Forked repository, click "Sync fork - Update Branch" to manually update to the latest official master branch, or install the [Pull](https://github.com/apps/pull) GitHub app to keep your fork synchronized with upstream.

### Method 2: Maintain fly.toml by yourself

1.  [Sign up for Fly.io](https://fly.io/app/sign-up) and install the [flyctl CLI](https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/);
2.  Create a new empty directory locally, run `fly launch` in it, and choose a unique name and instance region;
3.  Edit the generated fly.toml file, add

   ```toml
   [build]
   image = "diygod/rsshub:latest"
   ```

   Depending on the actual situation, you may want to use other image tags, please read the relevant content of [Docker Image](#docker-image);
4.  Modify the `[env]` section in fly.toml or use `fly secrets set KEY=VALUE` to [configure some modules](#configuration-route-specific-configurations);
5.  Execute `fly deploy` to start the application;
6.  (Optional) Use `fly certs add your domain` to configure a custom domain, and follow the instructions to configure the related domain resolution at your DNS service provider (you can check the domain configuration status on the Dashboard Certificate page).

Upgrade: Enter the directory where you saved the `fly.toml` file and execute `fly deploy` to trigger the steps of pulling the latest image and starting the upgraded application.

### Configure built-in Upstash Redis as cache

Run in the `RSSHub` folder

```bash
$ flyctl redis create
```

to create a new Redis database. Choose the same region as when you created the RSSHub app above, and it is recommended to enable [eviction](https://redis.io/docs/reference/eviction/). After creation, a string in the form of `redis://default:<password>@<domain>.upstash.io` will be printed.

Due to [a bug in a dependency](https://github.com/luin/ioredis/issues/1576), you currently need to append the `family=6` parameter to the URL provided by Fly.io, i.e., use `redis://default:<password>@<domain>.upstash.io/?family=6` as the connection URL.

Then configure the `[env]` section in fly.toml or run

```bash
$ fly secrets set CACHE_TYPE=redis REDIS_URL='<the connection URL>'
```

and execute `fly deploy` (if use the second install method) to trigger a redeployment to complete the configuration.
