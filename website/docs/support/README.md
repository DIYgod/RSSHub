# Support RSSHub

RSSHub is open source and completely free under the MIT license. However, just like any other open source projects, as the project grows, the hosting, development and maintenance require funding support.

You can support RSSHub via donations.

## Recurring Donation

Recurring donors will be rewarded via express issue response, or even have your name displayed on our GitHub page and website.

Open source is a very expensive thing. RSSHub would not be possible without the help of these individuals and organizations.
