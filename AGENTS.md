## Add a route

Doc: https://docs.rsshub.app/joinus/new-rss/start-code

### Folder

Implement your route in `/lib/routes/<domain>` folder.

### Getting data from the website

There are three approaches to getting data from the website. You should attempt in this order unless
the instructions say otherwise.

1. API (preferred)
    - use `ofetch` to send requests
    - If the website uses wordpress, you can call the wordpress API to get the data.
        - It's available at `https://<domain>/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`
2. HTML
    - use `cheerio` to parse the HTML
3. puppeteer
