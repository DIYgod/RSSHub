The content of 乳首ふぇち is divided into two parts:

Works: Only reposts official product descriptions.
Posts: Contains the website author's thoughts and additional information.

Sometimes a product may exist in both posts and works.
Sometimes there might be only a single post without any reposted work, and vice versa.
