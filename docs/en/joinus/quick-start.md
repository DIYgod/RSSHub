## Before you begin

Making a new RSS feed is not difficult, but it requires some basic knowledge of Git, HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Node.js. If you are not familiar with these technologies, you can learn them first.

If you don't know much about them but would like to learn them, here are some good resources:

-   [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
-   [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
-   [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
-   [Others' Code](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/tree/master/lib/v2)

## Submit new RSS rules

Before you start writing an RSS rule, please make sure that the source site does not provide RSS. Some web pages will include a link element with type `application/atom+xml` or `application/rss+xml` in the HTML header to indicate the RSS link.

### Getting started

In the following guide, you will learn things such as how to write a new RSS rule from scratch. This guide will also cover subjects like how to set up a proper development environment, keep your code clean and readable, and how to submit your code to the RSSHub repository.

## Submit new RSSHub Radar rules

### Before you start

It's suggested that you should have downloaded and installed RSSHub Radar in your browser before you start.

Once you have installed RSSHub Radar, open browser's RSSHub Radar extension settings, switch to rules list, scroll down and you will see a text box, copy your new rules into the text box and start debugging.
