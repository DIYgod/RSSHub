# Prerequisites

Before you begin, it is important that your development environment set up properly.

## Install Node.js

To be able to write new RSS rules, you must first install Node.js first. RSSHub requires Node v14 or above. You can download the latest LTS version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

On Windows, you can simply download the installer and follow the steps from the installer. Remember to check the option to install **Tools for Native Modules** as well.

On macOS, you can either download the installer from the Node.js website or use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Node.js with the command `brew install node`.

On Linux, you can refer to [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to decide how to install Node.js.

## Install a code editor

To write code, you need a code editor. If you already have one, you can skip this section. If you don't have one, you can choose one from the following list:

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
-   [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
-   [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
-   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

To speed up the development process and make it easier to keep your code clean, you can install some appropriate extensions to the code editor of your choice. In the latter part of this guide, we will use Visual Studio Code as an example, you can install the following extensions:

-   [Art Template Helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZihanLi.at-helper)
-   [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
-   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
-   [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

### Cloud hosted development environment

If you don't want to install Node.js and a code editor on your computer, you can also use a cloud-hosted development environment. You can use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), which is free for open source projects. Just click the button below to start a new workspace:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub)

In addiction to [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/), you can also use [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespace.new/), which requires beta access for individual users.

For more information about how to use [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) and [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespace.new/), see [Gitpod's documentation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/) and [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/codespaces).
