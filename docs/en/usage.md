# Getting Started

## Generate a RSS Feed

To subscribe to a Twitter user's timeline, first look at the route document of [Twitter User Timeline](en/social-media.html#user-timeline).

`/twitter/user/:id` is the route where `:id` is the actual Twitter username you need to replace. For instance, `/twitter/user/DIYgod` with a prefix domain name will give you the timeline of Twitter user DIYgod.

The demo instance will generate a RSS feed at <https://rsshub.app/twitter/user/DIYgod>, use your own domain name when applicable. This feed should work with all RSS readers conforming to the RSS Standard.

You can replace the domain name `https://rsshub.app` with your [self-hosted instance](/en/install/).

RSSHub supports additional parameters such as content filtering and full-text extraction, refer to [Parameters](/en/parameter.html) for details.

## Contribute a New Route

Our thriving community is the key to RSSHub's success, we invite everyone to join us and [contribute new routes](/en/joinus) for all kinds of interesting sources.

## Use as a npm Package

Apart from serving as an information source hub, RSSHub is also made compatible with all Node.js projects as an npm Package.

### Install

```bash
npm install rsshub --save
```

Or user Yarn

```bash
yarn add rsshub
```

### Usage

```js
const RSSHub = require('rsshub');

RSSHub.init({
    // config
});

RSSHub.request('/youtube/user/JFlaMusic')
    .then((data) => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch((e) => {
        console.log(e);
    });
```

For supported configs please refer to the [Configuration Section](/en/install/#configuration-3).

A short example for disabling caching can be written as:

```js
{
    CACHE_TYPE: null,
}
```
