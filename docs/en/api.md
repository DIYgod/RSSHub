RSSHub provides the following APIs:

### List of Public Routes

::: tip Tip
This API **will not** return any routes under `lib/protected_router.js`.
:::

Eg: <https://rsshub.app/api/routes/github>

Route: `/api/routes/:name?`

Parameters:

-   name, route's top level name as in [https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/tree/master/lib/routes](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/tree/master/lib/routes). Optional, **returns all public routes if not specified**.

A successful request returns a HTTP status code `200 OK` with the result in JSON:

```js
{
    "status": "success",
    "data": {
        "github": {
            "routes": [
                "/github/trending/:since/:language?",
                "/github/issue/:user/:repo",
                "/github/user/followers/:user",
                "/github/stars/:user/:repo"
            ]
        }
    },
    "message": "request returned 4 routes"
}
```

If no matching results were found, the server returns only a HTTP status code `204 No Content`.
