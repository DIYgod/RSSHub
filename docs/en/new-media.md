Compared to the official one, the RSS feed generated by RSSHub not only has more fine-grained options, but eliminates pull quotes which can't be easily distinguished from other paragraphs by any RSS reader but purely disrupts the reading flow. Besides that, this feed also provides users a bio of the author in the end of the article.
