# Deployment

RSSHub provides a painless deployment process if you are equipped with basic programming knowledge, you may open an [issue](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues/new/choose) if you believe you have encountered a problem not listed [here](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues), the community will try to sort it out asap.

The deployment may involve the followings:

1. Command line interface
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
4. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/zh-Hans/docs/install)

Deploy for public access may require:

1. [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)
2. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
4. [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
5. [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)
6. [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)

## Docker Image

We recommend using the latest version `diygod/rsshub` (i.e. `diygod/rsshub:latest`) of the docker image.

When the latest version is unstable, you can use the image with a date tag for temporary use. For example:

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub:2021-06-18
```

You can back to the latest version when the code has been fixed and rebuild the image.

To enable puppeteer, `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` is a good choice. If date specified, it will become: `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled-2021-06-18`.

Another approach to enable puppeteer is deploying with Docker Compose. However, it consumes more disk space and memory. By modifying `docker-compose.yml`, you can use `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` instead to reduce the disk space and memory consumption.

## Docker Compose Deployment

### Install

Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Check if any configuration needs to be changed

```bash
$ vi docker-compose.yml  # or your favorite editor
```

Create a docker volume to persist Redis caches

```bash
$ docker volume create redis-data
```

Launch

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Update

Remove old containers

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

Repull the latest image if you have downloaded the image before. It is helpful to resolve some issues.

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Configuration

Edit `environment` in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

## Docker Deployment

::: tip Tip

To enable puppeteer, replace `diygod/rsshub` with `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` in **EACH** command.

:::

### Install

Execute the following command to pull RSSHub's docker image.

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub
```

Start an RSSHub container

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rsshub -p 1200:1200 diygod/rsshub
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1200/](http://127.0.0.1:1200/), and enjoy it! ✅

Execute the following command to stop `RSSHub`.

```bash
$ docker stop rsshub
```

### Update

Remove the old container

```bash
$ docker stop rsshub
$ docker rm rsshub
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Configuration

The simplest way to configure RSSHub container is via system environment variables.

For example, adding `-e CACHE_EXPIRE=3600` will set the cache time to 1 hour.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rsshub -p 1200:1200 -e CACHE_EXPIRE=3600 -e GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=example diygod/rsshub
```

This deployment method does not include puppeteer (unless using `diygod/rsshub:chromium-bundled` instead) and Redis dependencies. Use the Docker Compose deployment method or deploy external dependencies yourself if you need it.

To configure more options please refer to [Configuration](#configuration).

## Ansible Deployment

This Ansible playbook includes RSSHub, Redis, browserless (uses Docker) and Caddy 2

Currently only support Ubuntu 20.04

Requires sudo privilege and virtualization capability (Docker will be automatically installed)

### Install

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
git clone https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub.git ~/RSSHub
cd ~/RSSHub/scripts/ansible
sudo ansible-playbook rsshub.yaml
# When prompt to enter a domain name, enter the domain name that this machine/VM will use
# For example, if your users use https://rsshub.example.com to access your RSSHub instance, enter rsshub.example.com (remove the https://)
```

### Update

```bash
cd ~/RSSHub/scripts/ansible
sudo ansible-playbook rsshub.yaml
# When prompt to enter a domain name, enter the domain name that this machine/VM will use
# For example, if your users use https://rsshub.example.com to access your RSSHub instance, enter rsshub.example.com (remove the https://)
```

## Manual Deployment

The most direct way to deploy `RSSHub`, you can follow the steps below to deploy`RSSHub` on your computer, server or anywhere.

### Install

Execute the following commands to download the source code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub.git
$ cd RSSHub
```

Execute the following commands to install dependencies (Do not add the `--production` parameter for development).

<code-block title="yarnv1">

```bash
yarn --production
```

</code-block>
<code-block title="npm">

```bash
npm install --omit=dev
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

### Launch

Under `RSSHub`'s root directory, execute the following commands to launch

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Or

```bash
$ npm start
```

Or use [PM2](https://pm2.io/docs/plus/quick-start/)

```bash
$ pm2 start lib/index.js --name rsshub
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1200/](http://127.0.0.1:1200/), and enjoy it! ✅

Refer to our [Guide](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/) for usage. Replace `https://rsshub.app/` with `http://localhost:1200` in any route example to see the effect.

### Configuration

::: tip Tip

On arm/arm64, this deployment method does not include puppeteer dependencies. To enable puppeteer, install Chromium from your distribution repositories first, then set `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` to its executable path.

Debian:

```bash
$ apt install chromium
$ echo >> .env
$ echo 'CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=chromium' >> .env
```

Ubuntu/Raspbian:

```bash
$ apt install chromium-browser
$ echo >> .env
$ echo 'CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=chromium-browser' >> .env
```

:::

RSSHub can be configured by setting environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`. For example:

```
CACHE_TYPE=redis
CACHE_EXPIRE=600
```

Please notice that it will not override already existed environment variables, more rules please refer to [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

This deployment method does not include Redis dependencies. Use the Docker Compose deployment method or deploy external dependencies yourself if you need it.

To configure more options please refer to [Configuration](#configuration).

### Update

Under `RSSHub`'s directory, execute the following commands to pull the latest source code for `RSSHub`

```bash
$ git pull
```

Then repeat the installation steps.

### A tip for Nix users

To install nodejs, yarn and jieba (to build documentation) you can use the following `nix-shell` configuration script.

```nix
let
    pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
    node = pkgs.nodejs-12_x;
in pkgs.stdenv.mkDerivation {
    name = "nodejs-yarn-jieba";
    buildInputs = [node pkgs.yarn pkgs.pythonPackages.jieba];
}
```

-   Sometimes PWD won't work as expected. If you encounter blank screen after `Start`, or some error during initialization, please retry

:::

## Configuration

Configure RSSHub by setting environment variables

### Network Configuration

`PORT`: listening port, default to `1200`

`SOCKET`: listening Unix Socket, default to `null`

`LISTEN_INADDR_ANY`: open up for external access, default to `1`

`REQUEST_RETRY`: retries allowed for failed requests, default to `2`

`REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: milliseconds to wait for the server to end the response before aborting the request with error, default to `3000`

`UA`: user agent, using random user agent (Chrome on macOS) by default

`NO_RANDOM_UA`: disable random user agent, default to `null`

### CORS Request

RSSHub by default reject CORS requests. This behavior can be modified via setting `ALLOW_ORIGIN: *` or `ALLOW_ORIGIN: www.example.com`.

### Cache Configurations

RSSHub supports two caching methods: memory and redis

`CACHE_TYPE`: cache type, `memory` or `redis`, empty this value will disable caching, default to `memory`

`CACHE_EXPIRE`: route cache expiry time in seconds, default to `5 * 60`

`CACHE_CONTENT_EXPIRE`: content cache expiry time in seconds, it will be recalculated when it is accessed, default to `1 * 60 * 60`

`REDIS_URL`: Redis target address (invalid when `CACHE_TYPE` is set to memory), default to `redis://localhost:6379/`

`MEMORY_MAX`: maximum number of cached items (invalid when `CACHE_TYPE` is set to redis), default to `256`

### Proxy Configurations

Partial routes have a strict anti-crawler policy, and can be configured to use proxy.

Proxy can be configured via either **Proxy URI** or **Proxy options**. When both are configured, RSSHub will use the configuration in **Proxy URI**.

#### Proxy URI

`PROXY_URI`: Proxy supports socks4, socks5(hostname is resolved locally, not recommanded), socks5h(hostname is
resolved by the SOCKS server, recommanded, prevents DNS poisoning or DNS leak), http, https. See [socks-proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socks-proxy-agent) NPM package page. See also [cURL OOTW: SOCKS5](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/05/26/curl-ootw-socks5/).

> Proxy URI's format:
>
> -   `{protocol}://{host}:{port}`
> -   `{protocol}://{username}:{password}@{host}:{port}` (with credentials)
>
> Some examples:
>
> -   `socks4://127.0.0.1:1080`
> -   `socks5h://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080` (username as `user`, password as `pass`)
> -   `socks://127.0.0.1:1080` (`socks5h` when protocol is `socks`)
> -   `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
> -   `http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:8080`
> -   `https://127.0.0.1:8443`

#### Proxy options

`PROXY_PROTOCOL`: Using proxy, supports socks, http, https, etc. See [socks-proxy-agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socks-proxy-agent) NPM package page and [source](https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy-agents/blob/63adbcefdb4783cc67c0eb90200886b4064e8639/packages/socks-proxy-agent/src/index.ts#L81) for what these protocols mean. See also [cURL OOTW: SOCKS5](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/05/26/curl-ootw-socks5/) for reference.

`PROXY_HOST`: host or IP of the proxy

`PROXY_PORT`: port of the proxy

`PROXY_AUTH`: credentials to authenticate a user agent to proxy server, `Proxy-Authorization: Basic ${process.env.PROXY_AUTH}`

`PROXY_URL_REGEX`: regex for url of enabling proxy, default to `.*`

### User Authentication Configurations

Routes in `protected_route.js` will be protected using HTTP Basic Authentication.

When adding feeds using RSS readers with HTTP Basic Authentication support, authentication information is required, eg: <https://usernam3:passw0rd@rsshub.app/protected/rsshub/routes>.

For readers that do not support HTTP Basic authentication, please refer to [Access Control Configuration](#access-control-configuration).

`HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_NAME`: HTTP basic authentication username, default to `usernam3`, please change asap

`HTTP_BASIC_AUTH_PASS`: HTTP basic authentication password, default to `passw0rd`, please change asap

### Access Control Configuration

RSSHub supports access control via access key/code, whitelisting and blacklisting, enabling any will activate access control for all routes. `ALLOW_LOCALHOST: true` will grant access to all localhost IP addresses.

#### White/blacklisting

-   `WHITELIST`: the blacklist. When set, values in `BLACKLIST` are disregarded

-   `BLACKLIST`: the blacklist

White/blacklisting support IP, route and UA as values, fuzzy matching. Use `,` as the delimiter to separate multiple values, eg: `WHITELIST=1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2,/qdaily/column/59`

#### Access Key/Code

-   `ACCESS_KEY`: the access key. When set, access via the key directly or the access code described above

Access code is the md5 generated based on the access key + route, eg:

| Access key  | Route             | Generating access code                   | Access code                      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| ILoveRSSHub | /qdaily/column/59 | md5('/qdaily/column/59' + 'ILoveRSSHub') | 0f820530128805ffc10351f22b5fd121 |

-   Routes are accessible via `code`, eg: <https://rsshub.app/qdaily/column/59?code=0f820530128805ffc10351f22b5fd121>

-   Or using `key` directly, eg: <https://rsshub.app/qdaily/column/59?key=ILoveRSSHub>

See the relation between access key/code and white/blacklisting.

|             | Whitelisted | Blacklisted | Correct access key/code | Wrong access key/code | No access key/code |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Whitelisted | ✅          | ✅          | ✅                      | ✅                    | ✅                 |
| Blacklisted | ✅          | ❌          | ✅                      | ❌                    | ❌                 |

### Logging Configurations

`DEBUG_INFO`: display route information on the homepage for debugging purposes. When set to neither `true` nor `false`, use parameter `debug` to enable display, eg: <https://rsshub.app/?debug=value_of_DEBUG_INFO> . Default to `true`

`LOGGER_LEVEL`: specifies the maximum [level](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston#logging-levels) of messages to the console and log file, default to `info`

`NO_LOGFILES`: disable logging to log files, default to `false`

`SENTRY`: [Sentry](https://sentry.io) dsn, used for error tracking

`SENTRY_ROUTE_TIMEOUT`: Report Sentry if route execution takes more than this milliseconds, default to `3000`

### Image Processing

::: tip New Config Format

We are currently testing out a new format, providing end-user with more flexibility. For more info, please refer to [Parameters->Multimedia processing](/en/parameter.html#multimedia-processing).

When using our new config, please leave the following environment vairable blank. By default, image hotlink template will be forced when present.

:::

`HOTLINK_TEMPLATE`: replace image URL in the description to avoid anti-hotlink protection, leave it blank to disable this function. Usage reference [#2769](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues/2769). You may use any property listed in [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL#Properties) (suffixing with `_ue` results in URL encoding), format of JS template literal. e.g. `${protocol}//${host}${pathname}`, `https://i3.wp.com/${host}${pathname}`, `https://images.weserv.nl?url=${href_ue}`

`HOTLINK_INCLUDE_PATHS`: limit the routes to be processed, only matched routes will be processed. Set multiple values with comma `,` as delimiter. If not set, all routes will be processed

`HOTLINK_EXCLUDE_PATHS`: exclude routes that do not need to be processed, all matched routes will be ignored. Set multiple values with comma `,` as delimiter. Can be used alone, or to exclude routes that are already included by `HOTLINK_INCLUDE_PATHS`. If not set, no routes will be ignored

::: tip Route matching pattern

`HOTLINK_INCLUDE_PATHS` and `HOTLINK_EXCLUDE_PATHS` match the root path and all recursive sub-paths of the route, but not substrings. Note that the path must start with `/` and end without `/`.

e.g. `/example`, `/example/sub` and `/example/anthoer/sub/route` will be matched by `/example`, but `/example_route` will not be matched.

It is also valid to contain route parameters, e.g. `/weibo/user/2612249974`.

:::

### Features

::: tip Experimental features

Configs in this sections are in beta stage, and **are turn off by default**. Please read corresponded description and turn on if necessary.

:::

`ALLOW_USER_HOTLINK_TEMPLATE`: [Parameters->Multimedia processing](/en/parameter.html#multimedia-processing)

`FILTER_REGEX_ENGINE`: Define Regex engine used in [Parameters->filtering](/en/parameter.html#filtering). Valid value are `[re2, regexp]`. Default value is `re2`. We suggest public instance should leave this value to default, and this option right now is mainly for backward compatibility.

`ALLOW_USER_SUPPLY_UNSAFE_DOMAIN`: allow users to provide a domain as a parameter to routes that are not in their allow list, respectively. Public instances are suggested to leave this value default, as it may lead to [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)

### Other Application Configurations

`DISALLOW_ROBOT`: prevent indexing by search engine, default to enable, set false or 0 to disable

`ENABLE_CLUSTER`: enable cluster mode, default to `false`

`NODE_ENV`: display error message on pages for authentication failing, default to `production` (i.e. no display)

`NODE_NAME`: node name, used for load balancing, identify the current node

`PUPPETEER_WS_ENDPOINT`: browser WebSocket endpoint which can be used as an argument to puppeteer.connect, refer to [browserWSEndpoint](https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser.wsendpoint)

`CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH`: path to the Chromium (or Chrome) executable. If puppeteer is not bundled with Chromium (manually skipped downloading or system architecture is arm/arm64), configuring this can effectively enable puppeteer. Or alternatively, if you prefer Chrome to Chromium, this configuration will help. **WARNING**: only effective when `PUPPETEER_WS_ENDPOINT` is not set; only useful for manual deployment, for Docker, please use the `chromium-bundled` image instead.

`TITLE_LENGTH_LIMIT`: limit the length of feed title generated in bytes, an English alphabet counts as 1 byte, the rest such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Arabic counts as 2 bytes by design, default to `150`

### Route-specific Configurations

::: tip Notice

Configs here are incomplete.

See docs of the specified route and `lib/config.js` for detailed information.

:::

-   Bitbucket: [Basic auth with App passwords](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/intro/#basic-auth)

-   Civitai
    -   `CIVITAI_COOKIE`: Cookie of Civitai

-   Discord

    -   `DISCORD_AUTHORIZATION`: Discord authorization token, can be found in the header of XHR requests after logging in Discord web client

-   Discuz cookie

    -   `DISCUZ_COOKIE_{cid}`: Cookie of a forum powered by Discuz, cid can be anything from 00 to 99. When visiting a Discuz route, use cid to specify this cookie.

-   disqus: [API Key application](https://disqus.com/api/applications/)

    -   `DISQUS_API_KEY`: Disqus API

-   douban

    -   `DOUBAN_COOKIE`: Cookie of douban user

    -   `EH_IPB_PASS_HASH`: The value of `ipb_pass_hash` in the cookie header after logging in E-Hentai
    -   `EH_SK`: The value of `sk` in the cookie header after logging in E-Hentai
    -   `EH_STAR`: The value of `star` in the cookie header if your account has stars. If this value is set, image limit allocation will links to the account rather than IP address
    -   `EH_IGNEOUS`: The value of `igneous` in the cookie header after logging in ExHentai. If this value is set, RSS will be generated from ExHentai
    -   `EH_IMG_PROXY`: Cover proxy address. If this is set, the link to the cover image will be replaced with this value at the beginning.
