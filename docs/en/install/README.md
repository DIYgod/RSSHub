# Deployment

RSSHub provides a painless deployment process if you are equipped with basic programming knowledge, you may open an [issue](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues/new/choose) if you believe you have encountered a problem not listed [here](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/issues), the community will try to sort it out asap.

The deployment may involve the followings:

1. Command line interface
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/zh-Hans/docs/install)

Deploy for public access may require:

1. [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) or [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
1. [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
1. [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/)

## Play with Docker

If you would like to test routes or avoid IP limits, etc., you may build your own RSSHub for free by clicking the button below.

[![Try in PWD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/play-with-docker/stacks/master/assets/images/button.png)](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/?stack=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/master/docker-compose.yml)

::: warning Warning

-   [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) account required
-   [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) instance will last for 4 hours at most. It should only be used for testing purpose
-   If deploy success but port cannot be auto-deteced，please click the `open port` button on the top and type `1200`
-   Sometimes PWD won't work as expected. If you encounter blank screen after `Start`, or some error during initialization, please retry

:::

## Docker Compose Deployment

### Install

Download [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/master/docker-compose.yml
```

Create a docker volume to persist Redis caches

```bash
$ docker volume create redis-data
```

Launch

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Update

Remove old containers

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Configuration

Edit `environment` in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

## Docker Deployment

### Install

Execute the following command to pull RSSHub's docker image.

```bash
$ docker pull diygod/rsshub
```

Start a RSSHub container

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rsshub -p 1200:1200 diygod/rsshub
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1200/](http://127.0.0.1:1200/), and enjoy it! ✅

Execute the following command to stop `RSSHub`.

```bash
$ docker stop rsshub
```

### Update

Remove old container

```bash
$ docker stop rsshub
$ docker rm rsshub
```

Then repeat the installation steps

### Configuration

The simplest way to configure RSSHub container is via system environment variables.

For example, adding `-e CACHE_EXPIRE=3600` will set the cache time to 1 hour.

```bash
$ docker run -d --name rsshub -p 1200:1200 -e CACHE_EXPIRE=3600 -e GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=example diygod/rsshub
```

To configure more options please refer to [Configuration](#configuration).

## Manual Deployment

The most direct way to deploy `RSSHub`, you can follow the steps below to deploy`RSSHub` on your computer, server or anywhere.

### Install

Execute the following commands to download the source code

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub.git
$ cd RSSHub
```

Execute the following commands to install dependencies

Using `npm`

```bash

```

Or `yarn`

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Launch

Under `RSSHub`'s root directory, execute the following commands to launch

```bash
$ npm start
```

Or

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Or use [PM2](https://pm2.io/docs/plus/quick-start/)

```bash
$ pm2 start lib/index.js --name rsshub
```

Visit [http://127.0.0.1:1200/](http://127.0.0.1:1200/), and enjoy it! ✅

Refer to our [Guide](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/) for usage. Replace `https://rsshub.app/` with `http://localhost:1200` in any route example to see the effect.

### Configuration

RSSHub can be configured by setting environment variables.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`. For example:

```
CACHE_TYPE=redis
CACHE_EXPIRE=600
```

Please notice that it will not override already existed environment variables, more rules please refer to [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

This deployment method does not include puppeteer and redis dependencies. Use the Docker Compose deployment method or deploy external dependencies yourself if you need it.

To configure more options please refer to [Configuration](#configuration).

### Update

Under `RSSHub`'s directory, execute the following commands to pull the latest source code for `RSSHub`

```bash
$ git pull
```

Then repeat the installation steps

## Heroku Deployment

[![Deploy](https://i.imgur.com/e6ZcmUY.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDIYgod%2FRSSHub)

## Google App Engine(GAE) Deployment

### Before You Begin

Follow the [official guide](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/quickstart) for completing your GCP account settings, creating a new Node project, adding billing information (required), installing git and initializing gcloud([link](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)). Node.js is not required if you don't plan to debug RSSHub locally.

Please note, GAE free tier doesn't support Flexible Environment, please check the pricing plan prior to deployment.

Node.js standard environment is still under beta, unknown or unexpected errors might be encountered during the deployment.

Execute `git clone https://github.com/DIYgod/RSSHub.git` to pull the latest code

### app.yaml Settings

#### Deploy to Flexible Environment

Under RSSHub's root directory, create a file `app.yaml` with the following content：

```yaml
# [START app_yaml]
runtime: custom
env: flex

# This sample incurs costs to run on the App Engine flexible environment.
# The settings below are to reduce costs during testing and are not appropriate
# for production use. For more information, see:
# https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/configuring-your-app-with-app-yaml
manual_scaling:
    instances: 1
# app engine resources, adjust to suit your needs, the required disk space is 10 GB

        - 443:1200
# environment variables section, refer to Settings
env_variables:
    CACHE_EXPIRE: '300'
# [END app_yaml]
```

#### Deploy to standard environment

Under RSSHub's root directory, create a file `app.yaml` with the following content：

```yaml
# [START app_yaml]
runtime: nodejs8

network:
    forwarded_ports:
        - 80:1200
