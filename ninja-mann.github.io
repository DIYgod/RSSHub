<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <p>Introducing a brand new editor for Markdown tables. Table rows and columns are now easier to create, edit, sort, reorder, select, copy, and paste. These new table features can also be accessed via context menu, command palette, and hotkeys. Tables are still saved to plain text Markdown.</p> <p><video src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/284392728-eeb5609f-0622-4a3b-b514-c35993703fa7.mp4" autoplay="true" muted="muted" style="max-height:400px; min-height: 200px" class="rounded-lg"></video></p> <p>To add a table to a note, right click and choose <em>Insert → Table</em>, or use the command palette.</p> <p>Once you insert a table, you can add new columns and rows by clicking on the sides of the table. Add text with inline formatting. Press <code>tab</code> to navigate between cells.</p> <h2>Improvements</h2> <h3>Properties</h3> <ul> <li>Properties can now be renamed globally. Renaming will cause the property to be modified in each corresponding file and the search is case-insensitive.</li> <li>Global Search: Search now works with non-string property values. Search for boolean values <code>[property:TRUE]</code> or <code>[property:FALSE]</code> or empty values <code>[property:EMPTY]</code>. You can also use inequality operators to search for things like <code>[some_property:&gt;10]</code>.</li> <li>Global properties view can now be filtered.</li> </ul> <h3>Editing experience</h3> <ul> <li>New formatting menu. You can now right click in the editor to change text formatting, paragraph styles, and insert elements such as lists and tables.</li> <li>Right-click on a callout to quickly change the callout type from a list of default callout type options.</li> <li>Pressing <code>Tab</code> when the <code>#</code> autocomplete is active will autocomplete the highlighted suggestion. If the highlighted suggestion has a <code>/</code> in it, like &quot;#projects/in-review&quot;, <code>Tab</code> will autocomplete by <em>segment</em>, so &quot;#projects&quot; then press again to get &quot;/in-review&quot;.</li> </ul> <h3>Sync</h3> <ul> <li>When viewing the version history for a file, changes made by the same user on the same device will now be grouped together. And Markdown will be rendered to more closely match reading mode.</li> <li>Number of vaults has increased from 5 to 10</li> <li>Maximum file size has increased from 100MB to 200MB</li> </ul> <p><img src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-help/assets/10565871/bf2334dd-6add-4dfa-9adb-67ff183746ec" alt="Sync version history"></p> <h3>Quality of life</h3> <ul> <li>The Outline view now has a &quot;collapse all&quot; button as well as a search field for filtering the list of headings in the file.</li> <li>Files from outside Obsidian can now be dropped anywhere in the File Explorer pane instead of on top of the vault name. Similarly, dropping a file on top of any item in a folder will cause the file to get imported into that particular folder.</li> <li>Pressing <code>Ctrl/Command-F</code> in any view with a search input (including Backlinks or Properties) will now focus the search input.</li> <li>Menu options within the <code>...</code> pane menu (the <code>...</code> in the tab header) as well as the tab menu (right clicking on a tab) have been cleaned up and should now show more relevant options.</li> <li>Copy, cut, and paste items in the Bookmarks view (works via hotkey only currently).</li> <li>Bookmarks: Removed the &quot;Bookmark this block...&quot; context menu item.</li> <li>Added new &quot;Show trash&quot; command to open the .trash folder in filesystem.</li> <li>The Appearance section in settings has been reordered for clarity.</li> </ul> <h3>Onboarding</h3> <ul> <li>Obsidian will now use the system setting for light or dark mode by default, you can change this in Appearance settings.</li> <li>Improved the experience when creating a new vault from scratch. If you select &quot;Create new vault,&quot; the created vault will include a <code>welcome.md</code> file and show a side-by-side view with the Graph view.</li> </ul> <h3>Bug fixes</h3> <ul> <li>The active context menu is now automatically dismissed when the view navigates away or a dialog appears.</li> <li>Clicking 'New file' on an empty tab should open the new file in the current tab instead of creating a new one.</li> <li>Properties: Fixed issue where properties view sometimes displayed a stale value when switching between files.</li> <li>Properties: Fixed bug where pressing the left arrow key (<code>←</code>) the start the input would cause the input to lose focus.</li> <li>Word count and character count status bar items now ignore frontmatter.</li> <li>Bookmarks: Fixed several edge cases where drag and drop would fail to work, including dragging an item to the bottom of the bookmark list.</li> <li>Fixed bug where canceling a drag would not cause the actively hovered element to remove its styling.</li> <li>Unclosed <code>[[</code> will no longer cause the next line to get rendered as a link.</li> <li>Updated &quot;Auto pair brackets&quot; behavior so that <code>[[link]]'s</code> can be typed without the apostrophe getting paired.</li> <li>Hover preview is no longer positioned on top of the cursor or target element if there isn't enough room to display the preview box.</li> <li>Editor selection no longer loses focus when resizing a tab group.</li> <li>Search: Minor tweak to avoid the content shifting a lot as the search counter ticks upward.</li> <li>Vim: Fixed issue with character movements not respective atomic ranges.</li> <li>Vim: Fixed issue where <code>O</code> on the first line of a file with properties would put the cursor in the wrong position.</li> </ul> <h2>Developers</h2> <ul> <li>As of 1.5.0, the <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/goodbye-legacy-editor/">Legacy editor has been completely removed</a> from Obsidian.</li> <li><a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Table">New CSS table variables for selection and dragging</a></li> </ul> <h2>Breaking changes</h2> <ul> <li>File Explorer and Tags pane both received a small code refactor.

<id>https://obsidian.md/changelog/2023-08-31-desktop-v1.4.5/</id>
<content type="html"><p>This update introduces Properties, a simple and durable way to add tags, links, dates, and other metadata to your notes. The core plugins Search, Templates, and Backlinks have all received upgrades to support Properties. Some of the new features in this release:</p> <ul> <li>A new UI for editing properties, with autocomplete for property names and values</li> <li>Properties can have types (e.g. text, list, date, number, checkbox) that make it faster to input data</li> <li>Properties can contain internal links to other notes</li> <li>New sidebar view lists all properties in your vault, and sort by name or frequency</li> <li>Keyboard navigation, commands, and hotkeys</li> <li>Search syntax for searching notes by property and value</li> <li>Templates automatically merge properties with existing properties in the note</li> <li>Data is still stored as YAML frontmatter at the top of each Markdown file. Metadata is automatically formatted as valid YAML.</li> </ul> <p>With this update you can also enable two-factor authentication for your Obsidian account.</p> <h2>Properties</h2> <img alt="Property Editor" src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/assets/693981/aea72173-5663-459d-83de-6ff888f6bdd5"> <p>Properties help you organize information about a note. Adding properties to a note helps you track structured data such as text, links, dates and numbers. Properties can also be used in combination with Community plugins that can do useful things with your structured data. <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties">Learn more.</a></p> <h3>Basic usage</h3> <p>To add a property to a note, you have several options:</p> <ul> <li>Use the <strong>Add file property</strong> command.</li> <li>Use the <strong><code>Cmd/Ctrl+;</code></strong> hotkey.</li> <li>Choose <strong>Add file property</strong> from the <strong>More actions</strong> menu (three dots icon) or right-clicking the tab.</li> <li>Type <code>---</code> at the very beginning of a file.</li> </ul> <p>Once you add a property, a row will appear at the top of the file with two inputs: the property <em>name</em> and the property <em>value</em>. Once you choose the property name you can give it a value and type.</p> <h3>Advanced usage</h3> <p>In addition to the inline property editor, there is a new <strong>Properties view</strong> core plugin that adds two new views for managing your properties:</p> <ul> <li><strong>All properties</strong> sidebar view shows a list of all the properties across your vault, and number of uses for each. Click on a property to search for all uses of it across your vault.</li> <li><strong>File properties</strong> sidebar view shows the properties for the active file. If you prefer to hide the inline property editor, you can choose to edit your file properties from the sidebar, without losing your place in the active file.</li> </ul> <p>Properties are an extremely powerful yet flexible feature that gives you even more ways to organize your information. See the <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties">documentation for Properties</a> for even more information.</p> <h2>Two-factor authentication (2FA) for Obsidian accounts</h2> <p>For even more security, you can now enable two-factor authentication on your Obsidian account. To do so, go to <a href="https://obsidian.md/account">obsidian.md/account</a> and enable &quot;2-factor authentication&quot;. This will prompt you with setup instructions.</p> <p><em>Note:</em> Any devices logging into Obsidian must be running v1.4.5+ to log-in using two-factor authentication.</p> <h2>Core plugin upgrades</h2> <ul> <li>Search: New <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Search#Search+properties">search syntax</a> for properties. <ul> <li>To find notes containing a property, use [<em>property</em>]</li> <li>To find notes with a property and a corresponding value, use [<em>property</em>:<em>value</em>]</li> <li>Both property and value allow complex sub-queries, such as parentheses for grouping, the OR operator, double-quotes for exact matching, and regex.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Templates: When using the &quot;Insert template&quot; command, properties inside template files will be merged with the current file.</li> <li>Backlinks: Properties with links will now properly show in backlink entries.</li> <li>Note Composer: Merging notes will now merge their properties.</li> </ul> <h2>Misc improvements</h2> <ul> <li>Search: Search autocomplete will now be shown based on the current input context.</li> <li>Live Preview now supports single column tables.</li> <li>Tag autocomplete now uses a fuzzy search algorithm.</li> <li>PDF: Added “Copy as quote” and “Copy annotation” context menu options</li> <li>PDF: Added a button to copy annotations from the annotation popup</li> <li>PDF: Added “Copy link to page” to PDF thumbnail context menu</li> <li>Editor: Formatting commands for <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, etc are now context-aware. For example, &quot;Toggle bold&quot; inside a bolded sentence will un-bold the sentence.</li> <li>Search: Removed the delay between typing and search happening.</li> <li>Sync: Always show a visual representation of storage usage.</li> <li>Numbers everywhere should now be formatted in the app. For example, word count and character count will have thousands separators.</li> <li>The Tags core plugin has been renamed to &quot;Tags view&quot;.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Fixed: PDF Viewer single page view resets to first page.</li> <li>Fixed: PDF viewer search settings unclickable when toggling sidebar.</li> <li>Fixed bug where closing an pop-out window with an active modal would keep the modal active.</li> <li>macOS: In frameless window mode, the top-right buttons no longer shift when creating/closing tab groups.</li> <li>File Recovery will now show a loading state when loading large vaults.</li> <li>Workspace: fix &quot;follow link under cursor&quot; commands in Canvas.</li> <li>Canvas: nudging selection should not cause stacked tabs to scroll.</li> <li>Outline: Fixed outline not rendering if the view was opened via the &quot;Show outline&quot; command.</li> <li>The &quot;New tab&quot; view will now show the current hotkeys.</li> <li>Editor: Scroll bar should no longer affect the position of the text when it appears on long documents.</li> <li>Vim: Fix for spellchecker.</li> </ul> <h2>Developers</h2> <ul> <li>The installer has been updated to use Electron v25.8.0 (requires downloading <a href="https://obsidian.md">the latest installer</a>).</li> <li>Vault: createFolder now return a <code>TFolder</code>.</li> <li>Metadata: <code>FrontMatterCache</code> no longer inherits from <code>CacheItem</code>.</li> <li>Theming: <a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/Editor/Properties">new CSS variables</a> have been added for Properties that start with <code>--metadata</code></li> <li>Disabled soft line width in <code>stringifyYaml</code> (this was causing some breakages with other plugins reading the YAML).</li> </ul> <h3>About Properties</h3> <h4>Internal Links</h4> <p>Internal links can be added to frontmatter using the following syntax:</p> <pre><code class="language-yaml">--- link: &quot;[[Link]]&quot; linklist: - &quot;[[Link]]&quot; - &quot;[[Link2]]&quot; --- </code></pre> <h4>About <code>tag</code>/<code>alias</code>/<code>cssclass</code> properties</h4> <p>As of 1.4.0, we have <strong>deprecated</strong> the &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;alias&quot;, and &quot;cssClass&quot; properties. The property editor will automatically convert these properties to <code>tags</code>, <code>aliases</code>, and <code>cssclasses</code> and the values will automatically be converted to lists.</p> <p>The old property names will still be identified correctly in the app, but the property editor will always prefer <code>tags</code>, <code>cssClasses</code>, and <code>aliases</code>.</p> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <p>Introducing <strong>Properties</strong>. A simple and durable way to add tags, aliases, dates, and other metadata to your notes. Your properties can even include links to other notes.</p> <img alt="property-editor" src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/assets/693981/aea72173-5663-459d-83de-6ff888f6bdd5"> <h3>Usage</h3> <ul> <li>New visual editor for properties in Live Preview and Reading mode.</li> <li>Property types: <ul> <li>Text — supports internal links</li> <li>List — supports internal links</li> <li>Number</li> <li>Checkbox</li> <li>Date</li> <li>Time</li> </ul> </li> <li>New commands for interacting with properties: <ul> <li>Add file property (<code>Ctrl/Command + ;</code>)</li> <li>Clear properties</li> <li>Edit property</li> <li>Show all properties</li> <li>Show file properties</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>All properties</strong> sidebar pane shows a list of all the properties across your vault, and number of uses for each.</li> <li><strong>File properties</strong> sidebar pane shows the properties for the active file.</li> <li>Cut/copy/paste properties.</li> </ul> <h3>Portability</h3> <p>Properties are saved directly to your note as <em>frontmatter</em>, a special section at the beginning of your file, encoded in YAML. This makes your note metadata readable in any plain text app, and compatible with many tools that support YAML frontmatter.</p> <h2>Improvements</h2> <ul> <li>Tag autocomplete now uses a fuzzy search algorithm.</li> <li>PDF: Added “Copy as quote” and “Copy annotation” context menu options.</li> <li>PDF: Added a button to copy annotations from the annotation popup.</li> <li>PDF: Added “Copy link to page” to PDF thumbnail context menu.</li> <li>Mermaid as been upgraded to v10.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Fixed: PDF Viewer single page view resets to first page.</li> <li>Fixed: PDF viewer search settings unclickable when toggling sidebar.</li> <li>Fixed bug where closing an pop-out window with an active modal would keep the modal active.</li> <li>macOS: In frameless window mode, the top-right buttons no longer shift when creating/closing tab groups.</li> <li>File Recovery modal will now show a loading state when loading large vaults.</li> <li>Workspace: fix &quot;follow link under cursor&quot; commands in Canvas.</li> <li>Canvas: nudging selection should not cause stacked tabs to scroll.</li> <li>Outline: Fixed outline not rendering if the view was opened via the &quot;Show outline&quot; command.</li> <li>The &quot;New tab&quot; view will now show the current hotkeys.</li> <li>Fixed sometimes arrows and markers disappear from mermaid diagrams. (Credits to @Bunker-D)</li> </ul> <h2>Developers</h2> <ul> <li>Vault: createFolder now return a <code>TFolder</code>.</li> <li>Metadata: <code>FrontMatterCache</code> no longer inherits from <code>CacheItem</code>.</li> <li>Theming: new CSS variables have been added for Properties that start with <code>--metadata</code>.</li> </ul> <h3>About Properties</h3> <h4>Internal Links</h4> <p>Internal links can be added to frontmatter using the following syntax:</p> <pre><code class="language-yaml">--- link: &quot;[[Link]]&quot; linklist: - &quot;[[Link]]&quot; - &quot;[[Link2]]&quot; --- </code></pre> <h4><code>tag</code>/<code>alias</code>/<code>cssclass</code> vs <code>tags</code>/<code>aliases</code>/<code>cssclasses</code></h4> <p>As of 1.4.0, we're <strong>deprecating</strong> the &quot;tag&quot;, &quot;alias&quot;, and &quot;cssClass&quot; frontmatter keys. The new property editor will automatically migrate to <code>tags</code>, <code>aliases</code>, and <code>cssclasses</code> and the values will automatically be converted to lists.</p> <p>The old keys will still be identified correctly in the app, but the property editor will always prefer <code>tags</code> and <code>aliases</code>.</p> </content>

<content type="html"><p>This update primarily focuses on Canvas improvements and overall bug fixes within the app.</p> <ul> <li><a href="#canvas-improvements">Canvas improvements</a> — Canvas settings, readonly mode, global search results, and more.</li> <li><a href="#bugfixes">Bugfixes</a> — fixes for Export to PDF, mermaid graph colors, and list numbering.</li> </ul> <h2>Canvas improvements</h2> <p>We've made a lot of improvements to Canvas since its initial release.</p> <h3>Arranging cards</h3> <p>Arranging cards on your canvas is now easier than ever. You can now resize multiple cards at once by dragging from the selection box. You can also <em>nudge</em> selected cards in any direction by pressing the arrow keys.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/220686409-b09002a7-ba40-42df-a76e-79d513bd8526.gif" alt="resize-multiple-cards"></p> <h3>Readonly mode</h3> <p>Once you have your cards arranged exactly how you like them, you can use the new <strong>readonly mode</strong> to lock your canvas content in place. While in readonly mode, a canvas and its contents cannot be modified.</p> <h3>Canvas settings</h3> <p>There is now a settings page for Canvas with the following configuration options:</p> <ul> <li>Default location for new canvas files.</li> <li>Use scroll wheel zoom instead of pan.</li> <li>Options to hide the card labels.</li> <li>Global setting for &quot;snap to grid&quot; and &quot;snap to objects.&quot;</li> <li>Configurable zoom threshold for when cards switch from showing their content to just showing the card title.</li> <li>Configurable behavior of <code>Ctrl/Command + Drag</code>.</li> </ul> <h3>Global search support</h3> <p>Content from text cards will now appear as search results in the global search view.</p> <h3>Background images for Canvas groups</h3> <p>Canvas groups can now have a background image associated with them. With a group selected, press the new &quot;set background&quot; button and choose an image from your vault.</p> <p>The image can be set to cover the entire group or be used as a repeating pattern.</p> <h3>Jump to group</h3> <p>The new &quot;Jump to group&quot; command allows you to search for groups in your open Canvas by name. Selecting a group will quickly pan the viewport to that group. Some other notable improvements to Canvas:</p> <h3>Narrow to block</h3> <p>Similarly to the &quot;Narrow to heading...&quot; feature, there is now a &quot;narrow to block&quot; menu item for file cards in the Canvas. Just right-click on a file card and choose &quot;Narrow to block...&quot; to see a list of all blocks in the given file. Selecting a block from the list will change the card to only display the contents of that block.</p> <h2>Bug fixes</h2> <ul> <li>Deleting a file now closes its tab if there are other tabs in the tab group.</li> <li>Obsidian Sync's settings page will now warn you if your vault is in Dropbox, iCloud, or OneDrive. Using multiple sync providers can lead to data conflicts.</li> <li>&quot;Follow link under cursor&quot; commands will now create a new canvas file if the linked canvas (i.e. <code>[[dashboard.canvas]]</code>) doesn't exist. Previously a Markdown file called <code>dashboard.canvas</code> would get created.</li> <li>Removed the redundant 🔗 icon from the tab header for linked tabs.</li> <li>Fixed LaTeX syntax highlighting.</li> <li>Fixed Mermaid gitgraph colors.</li> <li>Fixed bug where embeds and code blocks in Live Preview were not properly unloaded when switching files.</li> <li>Fixed context menu position when using &quot;Show context menu under cursor&quot; command while &quot;native menus&quot; is enabled.</li> <li>Fixed bug with &quot;fold less&quot; command not unfolding content on the selected line.</li> <li>File BOM will now automatically be stripped when Obsidian reads a file.</li> <li>When editing at the bottom of the window, the view will now scroll to have enough room to show the current line of text above the status bar.</li> <li>Fixed an issue where dragging tabs around the workspace sometimes causes an image in your clipboard to get pasted into the open editor.</li> <li>Color inputs now have a focus state when selected via the keyboard.</li> <li>Improved Mermaid text colors.</li> <li>The vim Codemirror extension has been updated to include all the latest upstream fixes and patches.</li> <li>Code blocks in Live Preview now show a copy icon if there is no language set.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Before you dive in</h2> <p>We've made some big changes both visually and under the hood for this release. If you rely on any third party plugins or themes, we highly encourage you to <strong>check for updates</strong> <em>before</em> delving into Obsidian 1.0.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Settings → Appearance → <em>Check for Updates</em></strong>.</li> <li><strong>Settings → Community plugins → <em>Check for Updates</em></strong>.</li> </ul> <p>This update includes significant changes to the look and feel of Obsidian. Some of the highlights include:</p> <ul> <li><a href="#tabs">Tabs</a> – The workspace now supports tabs. To accommodate tabs, we've made a lot of tweaks to Obsidian behaviors.</li> <li><a href="#tab-stacks">Tab stacks</a> – an alternative way to view your tabs, reminiscent of <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak's website</a>.</li> <li><a href="#new-appearance-settings">New appearance settings</a> – Obsidian has gone through an extensive redesign process to make the interface more robust, accessible, and easier to tinker with.</li> <li><a href="#additional-improvements">Tons of other misc. improvements</a> – New 'fold' commands, an overhauled Theme Gallery, and bug fixes galore!</li> </ul> <p>Make sure to take a look at the <a href="#faq">FAQ section</a> which should address some common points of confusion as you adapt to the new Obsidian.</p> <h2>Tabs</h2> <p>With this update, we have embraced <strong>tabs</strong> throughout the UI. We've found that tabs provide a more intuitive experience for both browsing and editing notes in your vault.</p> <p>Tabs have had us rethinking some of the most basic interactions with Obsidian. We have taken this opportunity to consolidate the hotkeys for opening files. Combine these modifier keys when clicking on any link in Obsidian (this includes the quick switcher!) or use them with <kbd>Enter</kdb> to navigate the link under the cursor.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Action</th> <th>MacOS</th> <th>Windows/Linux</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Navigate</strong></td> <td><em>None</em></td> <td><em>None</em></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>New Tab</strong></td> <td><kbd>⌘</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)</td> <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (+ <kbd>Shift</kbd> in Source Mode)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>New Tab Group</strong></td> <td><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd></td> <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>New Window</strong></td> <td><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></td> <td><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Tabs have also inspired some changes to how users browse their vaults. It felt only natural that we also introduce <strong>per-tab history</strong>. Each tab now maintains its own history for navigation.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/191052493-8109f1a1-411c-4b61-b435-788d0cac3231.png" alt="per-tab history"></p> <h2>Tab stacks</h2> <p>You can now switch any tab group in your workspace into a <em>tab stack</em>. Tab stacks provide an alternative way to view your tabs, reminiscent of Andy's Mode.</p> <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/693981/188205363-0f24b2a5-3706-4a8c-b38b-7a66baa68ce6.gif" alt="tab-stacks"></p> <p><em>Tab stacks</em> are, at their heart, the same as a tab group. Try mixing and matching with a tab group on one side and a tab stack on the other.</p> <h2>New appearance settings</h2> <p>We've introduced quite a few new settings at <strong>Settings → Appearance</strong>.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Setting</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Show inline title</strong></td> <td>Notes now display the full note title inline with the note contents as an <em>Inline Title</em>. You can disable this in settings</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Show tab title bar</strong></td> <td>Show or hide the title bar at the top of very tab.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Window frame style</strong></td> <td>By default, the UI is now in <em>Frameless</em> mode. The window title is hidden. In settings, you can choose between the new frameless mode, the custom Obsidian frame (old default), and using the native OS window frame.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Accent color</strong></td> <td>There's now an &quot;accent color&quot; color-picker to give your vault its own unique style. Theme support may vary.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Zoom level</strong></td> <td>Controls the overall zoom level of the app.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Native menus</strong></td> <td>Menus will be rendered to match the context menus provided by the operating system. Enabled by default on MacOS.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2>Additional improvements</h2> <ul> <li>The Theme Gallery has gotten a major overhaul. Themes now support versioning just like plugins. Note: Themes that are not compatible with 1.0 have been marked as &quot;legacy&quot; and cannot be installed until they get updated.</li> <li>Added &quot;collapse all&quot; button to file explorer and tag view.</li> <li>Added &quot;Fold more&quot; and &quot;Fold less&quot; commands for folding lines under the cursor.</li> <li>Added &quot;Change theme&quot; command for quickly switching between themes.</li> <li>Auto-generated links to headings now keep more punctuation characters for better contexts.</li> <li>Added &quot;Find &amp; Replace,&quot; Export PDF, Share, and text formatting items to macOS app menu.</li> <li>Added <code>Shift + Up/Down</code> hotkeys to expand search results while a search item is focused.</li> <li>Renamed &quot;Split vertically&quot; and &quot;Split horizontally&quot; to &quot;Split right&quot; and &quot;Split down&quot; to avoid ambiguity.</li> <li>Pressing <code>Home</code> will now move the cursor to the beginning of a list item.</li> <li>Obsidian Sync: The history view has a toggle to choose between seeing the version of a file at a point in time or seeing the diff.</li> <li>Release notes will now automatically show after Obsidian updates.</li> <li>Improved community theme/plugin README.md relative images, added support for videos.</li> <li>Renamed &quot;active file&quot; to &quot;current file&quot; in several commands for better consistency.</li> <li>Improved the overall appearance of the app when &quot;translucent window&quot; is enabled.</li> <li>Soft-wrapping of lines should now better avoid misaligned indents.</li> <li>Added an option to Export to PDF to show the name of the note at the beginning of the document.</li> <li>Publish: &quot;new&quot; and &quot;unchanged&quot; sections are now collapsed by default.</li> <li>Fixed bug with search results containing &quot;path:&quot; sometimes showing duplicate text.</li> <li>Fixed multi-line embedded queries not working.</li> <li>Fix memory leak with loading native system fonts.</li> <li>Fixed crash when file explorer is missing a sort order.</li> <li><code>Ctrl/Cmd+W</code> can now close the vault switcher and help window.</li> <li>File explorer keyboard navigation properly ignores hidden files.</li> <li>Clicking to edit Live Preview widgets (e.g. tables or callouts) will now scroll the view to the beginning of the widget.</li> <li>Word count now works for any text file that can be opened, not just <code>md</code> files.</li> <li>macOS: &quot;obsidian&quot; will now be capitalized in the App menu.</li> <li>macOS: commands will no longer refer to Finder as &quot;System Explorer.&quot;</li> <li>macOS: right-clicking on top of the cursor will no longer cause the word under the cursor to be selected.</li> <li>Added <code>show-theme</code> action to the Obsidian URI. It will open the given theme in the Community theme gallery. For example: <a href="obsidian://show-theme?name=Minimal">obsidian://show-theme?name=Minimal</a></li> </ul> <h2>For Developers</h2> <ul> <li>Workspace information is no longer saved to the <code>.obsidian/workspace</code> file. It is now saved to <code>workspace.json</code>.</li> <li>Added standard color picker component.</li> <li>Added <code>has-active-menu</code> class to file explorer item that received the right-click.</li> <li>Added <code>list-bullet</code> class to HTML markup for unordered list items.</li> <li>Theme developers: we have published <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/0-16-0-theme-migration-guide/42537">a guide for helping get your theme ready for 1.0</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>FAQ</h2> <p><strong>Q.</strong> Why am I seeing the title of my note duplicated at the top of my note?</p> <blockquote> <p>We now display the filename as an <strong>Inline Title</strong> to allow filenames to feel more attached to the note. If you already have the heading of your note matching the filename, you might notice some redundancy. You can disable this feature via <strong>Appearance → <em>Show inline title</em></strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Q.</strong> Why does everything look so big/small?</p> <blockquote> <p>The new update has made some changes to make Obsidian feel more native to your operating system. To adjust the overall scale of the UI, you can configure the <strong>UI Zoom</strong> level in Settings at <strong>Appearance → Advanced → <em>Zoom level</em></strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Q.</strong> How do I open notes side-by-side now?</p> <blockquote> <p>The behavior of <code>Cmd/Ctrl + Enter</code> and <code>Cmd/Ctrl + Click</code> have changed to opening links in a new tab. To open links in a new pane to the right, you can use <code>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Enter</code> or <code>Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + Click</code>.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Q.</strong> Why can't I toggle checkboxes with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> on MacOS) anymore?</p> <blockquote> <p>The default hotkey for &quot;Toggle checkbox status&quot; has been changed to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>L</kbd> (or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>L</kbd> on MacOS). <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>Enter</kbd> is now the default hotkey for opening links under the cursor in a new tab. You can change these hotkeys in settings.</p> </blockquote> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>Added &quot;Toggle always on top&quot; command to pin pop-out windows above all other windows on your desktop.</li> </ul> <h2>Improvements</h2> <ul> <li>The native scrollbar styling for macOS is back. This can still be overridden by themes.</li> <li>Views dragged out into their own pop-out will now preserve their previous pane size.</li> <li>Automatically refocuses the view in pop-out windows when cycling between windows.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Fixed &quot;Open in new window&quot; not giving the new pane focus.</li> <li>Copying to clipboard now works in pop-out windows.</li> <li>Fixed issue where the File Explorer didn't always respect the &quot;default note location&quot; setting.</li> <li>Backlinks in document will no longer disappear in pop-out windows.</li> <li>The toggle sidebar commands should now work again.</li> <li>Pop-out windows will now remember their position and size when restoring from maximize, minimize, or fullscreen.</li> <li>Fixed table wrapping issues in Live Preview.</li> <li>Fixed checkbox in callouts misaligned when using RTL.</li> </ul> <h2>Developers</h2> <ul> <li>We've made several improvements to the workspace API to improve plugin compatibility with v0.15.X. If you've been experiencing compatibility issues with your plugin (views opening in the wrong leaf, files opening without focus), we recommend testing against this version to see if the issues have been resolved.</li> <li>For plugin and theme developers: we've made changes to the <code>Suggest</code> component's DOM structure. If your plugin is attaching itself to core Suggest components or mimicking the Suggest component structure, it will likely be impacted. <ul> <li>The new DOM structure is:</li> </ul> <pre><code>- .suggestion-item - .suggestion-content - .suggestion-title - .suggestion-note (optional) - .suggestion-aux - .suggestion-hotkey (optional) - .suggestion-flair (optional) </code></pre> </li> <li>The behavior of <code>workspace.getActiveFile</code> has been updated to now return the file of the most recently active FileView. This change should improve compatibility for custom views now that sidebar views are focusable. If you were previously using <code>workspace.getMostRecentlyActiveFile</code> for v0.15.X compatibility, please switch back to <code>getActiveFile</code>.</li> <li>Note: Theme developers can avoid overriding the macOS native scrollbars by targeting <code>body:not(.native-scrollbars)</code> for any scrollbar styling.</li> </ul> </content>

Items from the same section will be grouped together, in the order they were defined or first used. The default section (empty string) will contain all legacy/plugin/unspecified menu items and is usually put into a specific spot of the sort order (for example, before the danger items). Inspect the DOM to see existing sections' <code>data-section</code>.</li> <li>We've removed the ability to create <code>MenuItem</code> directly - please use <code>Menu.addItem</code> instead.</li> <li>On <code>View</code>, we've deprecated the <code>onHeaderMenu</code> and <code>onMoreOptionsMenu</code> in favor of a single <code>onPaneMenu</code> function with a <code>source</code> parameter. This new method will be used for both the header menu (right clicking on a tab header in the sidebar) and the more options menu (three dot menu).</li> </ul> </content>

<id>https://obsidian.md/changelog/2022-02-22-mobile-v1.1.0/</id>
<content type="html"><h2>Core update</h2> <p>Includes all new functionality and bug fixes up to Obsidian Desktop v0.13.24. This update also allows all new cm6-compatible plugins to run.</p> <p><strong>Live Preview</strong> While this feature works pretty well already, it hasn't been fully mobile optimized, so there could still be some usability issues when using with a touch-only device, such as editing embeds and code blocks. In the meantime, feel free to use Source Mode when that happens. You can do that by long-holding the 3 dot button on the top right and hitting &quot;Toggle Live Preview/Source mode&quot; (or run a command from the pull down menu or bottom toolbar).</p> <p><strong>Vim mode</strong> Support for vim mode is now available, but must be enabled on a per-device basis on mobile. It is not really usable on a mobile device without an external keyboard.</p> <p><strong>Others</strong> Drag and drop features from desktop is now generally available across the app, and can be triggered by long-holding items. This includes drag and drop files and folders, starred items, and outline items.</p> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>You can now search for tasks using <code>task:</code> similar to <code>block:</code>. There is also <code>task-todo:</code> and <code>task-done:</code> which will match only the tasks that are incomplete or complete, respectively. Use <code>task:&quot;&quot;</code> to match all tasks.</li> <li>Search and backlink results has been significantly reworked: <ul> <li>Search results are now always expanded, instead of showing &quot;... and x more matches&quot;.</li> <li>&quot;Show more context&quot; will now show the Markdown block, instead of a fixed number of lines before and after the match.</li> <li>There are now buttons to expand individual search results to see even more context.</li> <li>Hover preview on search results will now scroll the highlighted region to the center rather than being clipped at the top.</li> </ul> </li> <li>You can now display backlinks inside the document using the more options menu while in preview mode. We will try to support edit mode in a future release.</li> <li>Task lists <code>[x]</code> can now contain any character to indicate a completed task, instead of just <code>x</code>. This value can be used by custom CSS to change the appearance of the check mark, and is also available for plugins to use.</li> <li>There are now hotkeys to show the panes for file explorer, backlinks, outline, starred, and tag pane.</li> <li>You can now change the font size in the editor and preview with an option in Settings &gt; Appearance, or using <code>Ctrl/Cmd + up/down scroll</code>. Some themes may have set overrides for the font size, so this setting might not work for you. See the developer section for details.</li> </ul> <h2>Improvements</h2> <ul> <li>Major improvements to plugin management: <ul> <li>Plugin search now also matches in the description field as well.</li> <li>You can now filter installed plugins using a search term.</li> <li>Enabled plugins are no longer reset when you toggle safe mode. This can help quickly test whether issues are caused by plugins.</li> <li>Plugins can now be enabled or disabled in the same place where they are installed, so you can enable it right away after install, instead of having to find them in the plugins list.</li> <li>The &quot;update&quot; button will no longer show up if a plugin doesn't have a new version.</li> <li>Plugin setting tabs are now sorted alphabetically.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Obsidian Sync will now store a customizable device name which will show up in the sync log to help debug sync issues.</li> <li>Obsidian Publish now allows search on your site even if you don't turn on navigation.</li> <li>You can now specify a logo file for Obsidian Publish.</li> <li>There is now an option to reload the app when an error happens during initialization.</li> <li>There is now a notification when the app first indexes the vault to avoid confusion why some features might not work right away.</li> <li>Link suggestions and quick switcher will now fallback to a simpler matching algorithm when vault contains over 10k notes to avoid delays.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Renaming files no longer cause heading links to self (<code>[[#heading]]</code>) to include the file name.</li> <li>The Workspaces plugin will now save to the proper workspace if the app was closed and restarted right after switching workspaces.</li> <li>Fixed some i18n strings that weren't properly loaded and always used the English variants due to a race condition.</li> <li>File names with multiple consecutive space characters now render properly, instead of having the spaces collapse into one.</li> <li>Generated Markdown links now properly escapes backslashes.</li> <li>Fixed embedded queries behave differently than global search when matching attachment files.</li> <li>Fixed linking unlinked mentions not using preferred Markdown link format.</li> <li>Word counter for Korean now properly counts words rather than letters.</li> <li>Fixed Shift-select in the file explorer accidentally selecting unsupported files that were not shown, causing unexpected file moves when using drag and drop after.</li> </ul> <h2>Developers</h2> <ul> <li>Theme developers: from now on, please avoid setting font-size using absolute units like <code>px</code> or <code>pt</code>. Instead, use relative units like <code>em</code> or <code>%</code>, which will automatically scale from the font size the user specified. To migrate <code>px</code> to <code>em</code>, you can divide your px value by 16 (the default font size), for example, <code>24px =&gt; 1.5em</code>.</li> <li>Commands that return false in their <code>checkCallback</code> will no longer set <code>preventDefault()</code> on the key event.</li> <li>MetadataCache now includes <code>sections</code> and <code>lists</code> info. <ul> <li>Sections describe the Markdown root level &quot;blocks&quot;, and comes with a <code>type</code>.</li> <li>Lists comes with a <code>parent</code> field which can be used to deduce parent-child relationships, and also a <code>task</code> field which indicates whether this is a task and its completed status.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>MarkdownRenderChild</code> now requires a <code>containerEl</code> passed in via its constructor.</li> <li>You can now retrieve section information as a <code>MarkdownPostProcessor</code> from the context object <code>MarkdownPostProcessorContext.getSectionInfo()</code>.</li> </ul> </content>

This can be used to search for pages and headings.</li> </ul> <h2>Improvements</h2> <ul> <li>A layout independent mode has been introduced for hotkeys, which should work consistently across different keyboard layouts. This mode uses the virtual key code that's assigned to each physical key instead of the resulting character that's inputted when the combination is pressed.</li> <li>Drag and drop links will no longer create a Markdown link if the link title is identical to the URL.</li> <li>Improved behavior of <code>Ctrl/Cmd+Click</code> and <code>Alt+Enter</code> for links in the editor.</li> <li>Holding <code>Shift</code> while dropping text will drop it in plaintext mode, similar to <code>Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+V</code> to paste in plaintext mode.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Closing the vault or quitting the app within 2 seconds of editing a file will no longer lose the modifications done within that last 2 seconds.</li> <li>The bug where file explorer gains unusual whitespace has been caught and squashed.</li> <li>Fixed window size and developer tools were not properly saved when quitting app.</li> <li>Toggling highlight will no longer remove bold <code>**</code> signs.</li> </ul> <h2>Developers</h2> <ul> <li>Exposed <code>WorkspaceItem.getRoot()</code> which returns one of <code>Workspace.leftSplit</code>, <code>Workspace.rightSplit</code>, or <code>Workspace.rootSplit</code>. This can be used to distinguish whether a <code>WorkspaceLeaf</code> is in the center area or the sidebars.</li> <li>A new event has been added to <code>Workspace.on('quit', callback: (tasks: Tasks) =&gt; any)</code>. This takes a callback with a <code>Tasks</code> object. You can perform any cleanup tasks in here. For any async/promise-based cleanups, such as saving files, add your task to the execution queue using <code>Tasks.add(async () =&gt; { ... })</code> or <code>Tasks.addPromise(promise)</code> so that the app waits until your task is finished before quitting.</li> <li>The rendering lifecycle has been tweaked to allow plugins to add sub-components in the renderer post process step. Look for <code>MarkdownPostProcessorContext.addChild</code> for more details.</li> </ul> </content>

You can now: <ul> <li>Choose to show arrows for links.</li> <li>Change the size of nodes and the thickness of links.</li> <li>Change the centering force, the repelling force, the link force, and the link distance.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Local graph also has a few new option available. You can now: <ul> <li>Choose to hide incoming or outgoing links.</li> <li>Choose to showing neighbor links. Disabling this option hides links between neighbor notes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>You can now navigate the graph using the keyboard. Arrow keys to pan, <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> to zoom, <code>Shift</code> to speed up movement.</li> <li>All graph options, including local graph depth and zoom level, are now persisted through restarts.</li> <li>Dragging to pan now has inertia. Zooming has been reworked to be much smoother.</li> <li>Graph colors now support custom CSS <code>color: rgba()</code> values as well as <code>opacity: 0.5</code>.</li> <li>New graph CSS classes are <code>.color-fill-tag</code>, <code>.color-fill-attachment</code>, <code>.color-fill-unresolved</code>, and <code>.color-arrow</code>.</li> <li>Graph simulation is now done in a worker thread. This should make large graphs much more manageable.</li> <li>Several optimizations have been implemented to make the graph blazingly fast on vaults of all sizes. Many tricks are commonly used in modern day video games!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Obsidian now supports <code>obsidian://</code> URIs. For the user manual, check out the help doc <code>Advanced use &gt; Using obsidian URI</code>. <ul> <li>Remember to use <code>%20</code> to encode the space character, and <code>%2F</code> to encode the forward slash <code>/</code>.</li> <li><code>obsidian://open?vault=myvault</code> will open the vault &quot;myvault&quot;.</li> <li><code>obsidian://open?vault=myvault&amp;file=mynote</code> will open the file &quot;mynote&quot; inside the vault &quot;myvault&quot;/</li> <li><code>obsidian://open?path=%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmynote</code> will open the file at the absolute path &quot;/absolute/path/to/mynote&quot; assuming a vault exists for the one of the parent folders.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The two shorthand from v0.8.15 are still available: <ul> <li>The vault format: <code>obsidian://vault/myvault</code>.</li> <li>The vault + file format: <code>obsidian://vault/myvault/mynote</code>.</li> <li>The <strong>triple</strong> slash format for absolute paths: <code>obsidian:///absolute/path/to/mynote</code> or on Windows <code>obsidian:///C:\path\to\mynote</code> (forward slash also works).</li> </ul> </li> <li>New CSS classes are added for <code>#tags</code> in the editor for those interested in styling different tags in different colors. For a hypothetical tag <code>#mytag</code>, the class will be <code>.cm-tag-mytag</code>. Unfortunately, this only supports English letters, <code>-</code>, and <code>_</code>, since those are the limitations of CSS class names.</li> <li>New CSS classes are now added to <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> to indicate the operating system. They are <code>.mod-macos</code>, <code>.mod-windows</code>, and <code>.mod-linux</code>.</li> <li>Markdown importer can now convert Bear style highlight <code>::highlight::</code>.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Global search and edit mode <code>find</code> functionality now copies selected text into the search bar when triggered.</li> <li>The vault switcher window now has a language switcher.</li> <li>Search should now be much faster if only using <code>file:</code> or <code>path:</code> operators, because the file content does not need to be loaded.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>On Windows, the vault switcher should now show vault name instead of the full path, which took a lot of unnecessary space.</li> <li>Splitting a new pane sometimes caused the new pane to be very thin. That should now be fixed.</li> <li>Clicking on <code>file:///</code> links should now work properly on Linux. This was broken on a previous release.</li> <li>On MacOS, sometimes when double clicking the app titlebar to zoom, the window disappears and can't be made to reappear even if restarting the app. This will no longer happen.</li> </ul> </content>

This will open the file in the most nested vault that's capable of opening this file.</li> <li>If the URL does not do anything, then it means the file does not belong to any vault you have previously opened.</li> <li>If the vault opens, but does not navigate to the specified note, then it means the file of that path was not found.</li> <li>On Linux, you will have to setup an obsidian.desktop file with <code>Exec=obsidian %u</code>.

In the plugin setting, you can tell the plugin what to replace <code>{{date}}</code> and <code>{{time}}</code> with. <code>{{title}}</code> will be replaced by the title of the current file.

This will automatically encode spaces as <code>%20</code>.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>We've now switched from Markdown-It to Remark to parse Markdown files. This will inevitably change how some of your notes look like, since Remark is not fully CommonMark compliant.

This shouldn't happen anymore.</li> <li>Pasting control characters (which are also invalid for file names) in the file rename field no longer causes an exception.</li> <li>LaTeX rendering using MathJax should no longer be broken if accidentally changed MathJax renderer using the right-click menu.</li> <li>Mermaid graphs that couldn't be rendered due to an error won't scroll the whole app anymore.</li> <li>Duplicate embeds, LaTeX, and code blocks now properly renders instead of having the first one disappear.</li> <li>Spellcheck correction is now properly applied when using custom CSS themes that reduce line height.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>There is now a &quot;local&quot; graph view available. This is bound to a file, only showing notes related to the linked pane, similar to how backlinks and outline pane works. Use the &quot;More options&quot; menu to find the new &quot;Open local graph&quot; option. Try putting it in a sidebar!</li> <li>Graph view now updates in real time when files are created, removed, or when links are changed.</li> <li>Obsidian is now translated to several different languages thanks to our lovely community members. This version comes with full support for English and 中文 (Chinese), and partial support for Deutsch, Français (French), русский (Russian) and Türkçe (Turkish). If you would like to help translate Obsidian to your native language, join our Discord <code>#translations</code> channel.</li> <li>The Slides plugin has been revamped and updated. It now supports image/audio/video embeds, LaTeX, code blocks and mermaid graphs.</li> <li>The Zettelkasten prefixer plugin now has a template file option.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Renaming folders now properly updates all affected links. Creating or renaming files that causes duplicate names will now update links to absolute links to avoid conflicts.</li> <li>Search performance has been improved. It will now match files much faster, where it was previously limited to 600 files per second.</li> <li><code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags are no longer permitted in raw HTML. This is because the HTML standard disallows <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags within <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>; they are only permitted in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Switching from edit to preview mode had a brief flash before changes are applied, that no longer is the case.</li> <li>The editor no longer inserts an extra pair of <code>]]</code> closing brackets when &quot;smart indent list&quot; is turned off.</li> <li>Outline plugin no longer switches to a media file if one is opened in the editor. Now it more accurately just says &quot;No headings found.&quot;</li> <li>PDFs that previously had missing characters now render properly.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><p>Lots of under the hood improvements on this one. Everyone should be made slightly happier, and a few people will be made much happier.</p> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Opening very large documents in Preview mode will now work much better. We now only render block elements that are in view, and anything that's outside of the visible scroll area is temporarily hidden for performance (tested on &quot;War and Peace&quot; at 3MB/570k words).</li> <li>LaTeX now has full MathJax input library included, which should allow the imported libraries to work.</li> <li>Pressing the <code>Enter</code> key in the search query will run the query again even if it hasn't been changed.</li> <li>The account tab now has a loading animation, instead of showing a &quot;login&quot; page before quickly flashing to the logged in version.</li> <li>Search results are now sorted (by path alphabetic) instead of going through files in a somewhat-random order.</li> <li>Tags can now use <code>_</code> (underscore) as part of the name.</li> <li>Video and audio embeds are now loaded in chunks as they are played, instead of being fully loaded into memory when they open. This should also fix any performance issues and crashes related to having many media embeds in the same file.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Graph view now properly recognizes heading links to the same file.</li> <li>Search should now properly show all results, instead of having the last few disappear when scrolling.</li> <li>The highlighting for <code>]]</code> was fixed again for some edge cases.</li> <li>Panes that overflow to the right side should no longer push other panes around due to a CSS bug.</li> <li>Spellcheck dictionary overflow in settings should no longer happen.</li> <li>The outline when clicking a LaTeX expression in preview mode has been removed.</li> <li>Long words and URLs now wrap correctly, instead of overflowing and requiring scrolling to see.</li> <li>Daily notes settings page should show the format correctly now the first time when you open it.</li> <li><code>Ctrl/Cmd+D</code> used to not work in Vim mode because it was bound to another operation; that should now work properly to scroll down half a page.</li> <li>Unsupported files, most notably <code>obsidian.css</code>, should no longer show up in quick switcher.</li> <li>Some parts of the interface previously allowed text selection, which was confusing. That should no longer happen.</li> <li>Fixed an editor crash issue caused by using a checklist inside a footnote.</li> <li>Word count for large files should no longer cause lag.</li> <li>Changing custom CSS no longer causes the editor to enter a broken state until the app is reloaded.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>There's now a new Outline plugin, which works in the same way as the backlinks pane. An &quot;unlinked&quot; sidebar pane will show the outline of the current file, while a &quot;linked&quot; pane will always show the outline of the linked pane.</li> <li>Open with Default App plugin now also adds &quot;Show in Folder&quot; option which will open the system file manager and highlight the file.</li> <li>You can now scroll beyond the last line of the file.</li> <li>HTML tags with <code>style</code> properties are now allowed to be added to elements, style all the things!</li> <li>HTML <code>iframe</code> tags are now allowed, which can be used to embed various external pages like YouTube, Google Maps, etc.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Graph view now has smoother fading animations when hovering with mouse.</li> <li>Search regex now uses multiline mode, which means <code>^</code> will now match beginning of line and <code>$</code> will now match end of line.</li> <li>Link auto-complete and quick switcher would match the file name as a priority, instead of always matching the full path. This should improve the match ordering for searcher that contain characters in the parent folder, such as searching for &quot;task&quot; in &quot;test/task.md&quot; which previously matched &quot;[t]est/t[ask]&quot; instead of &quot;test/[task]&quot;.</li> <li>The HTML sanitizer is now a lot faster, making large documents more performant.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Switching between edit mode and preview mode no longer loses your scroll position from the top, so you won't have to scroll all the way down again.</li> <li>Global search fixes: <ul> <li>&quot;quoted string&quot; did not properly match full words when containing punctuation or whitespace characters, such as &quot;- [ ]&quot;. It should work now.</li> <li>/regex/ previously required two backslashes to escape characters, for example, <code>/\[\]/</code> previously didn't work, requiring <code>/\\[\\]/</code>. Now you don't need to add the second backslash.</li> <li>When clicking on a search result, sometimes the highlights were off by a few characters. This was caused by Windows-style line endings &quot;\r&quot;, and should no longer cause any trouble.</li> <li>Search results sometimes didn't show all results when scrolling. Also sometimes the results would flicker and jump around. That should stop happening now.</li> <li>Fixed search operator <code>ignore-case:</code> previously made the search case sensitive instead of what it says it does, oops.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Link autocomplete should no longer generates a leading <code>/</code> for relative links.</li> <li>Fixed <code>]]</code> not properly styled in headings, which made them appear really small.</li> <li>Table headers are now properly aligned using table alignment options.</li> <li>Fixed editor horizontal scrollbar hidden behind text, so it could not be interacted with.</li> <li>Fixed <code>$$</code> latex blocks couldn't contain single dollar signs <code>$</code>.</li> <li>Backlinks pane now no longer cause lag when switching documents in a vault with heavy linking.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>Major new feature: Search has been massively improved and expanded! Check this out: <ul> <li>Words in the search query separated by space will be searched independently in each file.</li> <li><code>&quot;Quoted strings&quot;</code> can be used to perform full word match. <code>&quot;test&quot;</code> will not match the word <code>testing</code>. Use backslash <code>\&quot;</code> to escape double quotes and <code>\\</code> to escape backslash.</li> <li>Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search. Use forward slash to denote a regular expression. For example: <code>/[a-z]{3}/</code>.</li> <li>Boolean operations can now be used. Use <code>OR</code> to match one or another. Use <code>-</code> to negate a query. The space character is used for boolean &quot;and&quot;.</li> <li>Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations. For example <code>(a OR b) (c OR d)</code>.</li> <li>Several special operators are available. Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example: <code>file:(&quot;to be&quot; OR -&quot;2B&quot;)</code>. <ul> <li><code>file:</code> will perform the following subquery on the file name. For example: <code>file:&quot;.jpg&quot;</code>.</li> <li><code>path:</code> will perform the following subquery on the file path, absolute from the root. For example: <code>file:&quot;Daily Notes/2020-07&quot;</code>.</li> <li><code>match-case:</code> and <code>ignore-case:</code> will override the case sensitive match logic for the following subquery.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are now options in the search interface to provide different types of results: <ul> <li><code>Collapse results</code> will toggle between just showing matching note names and showing the lines in which matches appear. These extended results can be toggled for each note by clicking on the folding triangle next to the file name.</li> <li><code>Match Case</code> will do what it says, but note that it can be overridden on a per-search basis as per above.</li> <li><code>Explain Search Terms</code> will show you what the search is actually looking for in plain terms, so you can debug complex searches.</li> </ul> </li> <li>And search results are now optimized to only render results visible in the scrollable box. This means no more lag when there are a lot of search matches.</li> <li>You can also star search queries for quick navigation using the &quot;Starred&quot; plugin.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There is a new option for link suggestions to auto-complete paths in relative format, vault-absolute format, or our default &quot;shortest unique path&quot;. This option can be found in Settings &gt; File.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Daily Notes plugin now adds commands to go to previous and next day's note, if they exist. You will only see these in the Command Palette if you are in a daily note. A daily note for these purposes is defined as &quot;matching the date format set in the daily notes plugin settings,&quot; so so any notes that don't use the specified date format won't be navigated to.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Excessive padding for media embeds (images, audio, video) have been slimmed down.</li> <li>There was a bug in the recognition of tags with numbers wherein some would be shown as tags in preview but not edit mode. That is fixed now.</li> <li>And we fixed the thing where toggle highlight command would just add more <code>==</code> instead of toggling as the name would suggest.</li> <li>Mermaid graphs would sometimes have boxes clip the last few letters of the text. That shouldn't happen anymore.</li> </ul> </content>

Add &quot;https://&quot; for it to be recognized. (For example, <code>obsidian.md</code> vs <code>https://obsidian.md</code>)</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Sometimes trying to auto-link backlinks in &quot;unlinked mentions&quot; could be clicked multiple times producing a <code>[[link]]nk]]nk]]</code>. Thankfully, that no longer happens.</li> <li>We fixed LaTeX sometimes hanging the app if <code>$</code> was included in the middle.</li> <li>We also fixed LaTeX couldn't include escaped <code>$</code>. You can now do that with <code>\$</code></li> <li>We've optimized HTML rendering to speed up re-rendering for big documents.</li> <li><code>Ctrl/Cmd-B</code> and <code>Ctrl/Cmd-I</code> are now customizable.</li> <li>Indenting/unindenting using &quot;smart indent lists&quot; should no longer become &quot;NaN.&quot;</li> <li>Consecutive links <code>[[link1]][link2]]</code> now links to the correct place in edit mode.</li> </ul> </content>

Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; Spellcheck (gears icon) to remove words from the dictionary.</li> <li>Pinning panes will now be applied to the whole group of linked panes.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>&quot;Replace all&quot; can now undo and redo in a single operation.</li> <li><code>Ctrl/Cmd-[</code> and <code>Ctrl/Cmd-]</code> no longer override vim mode.</li> <li>We added a notice for when saving fails, which could happen if the USB drive containing the vault is ejected.</li> <li>We fixed the <code>split pane</code> command and shortcut creating empty panes when current pane was pinned.</li> <li>Footnotes now go to the right place. The link destination will now also be highlighted.</li> <li>We fixed the bug where front-matter containing the string <code>---</code> could cause the editor to crash.</li> <li>Auto-detected URLs in the editor will no longer include the space or period characters after.</li> <li>And we fixed &quot;Focus on above/below/left/right pane&quot; option not always finding the correct pane to focus.</li> <li>Graph view now stops all activity soon after you stop interacting with it. This should save quite some CPU cycles if you prefer to have a graph open at all times.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>We've added command palette options for navigation between panes (up/down/left/right), as well as open in default app. And, yes, you can make them hotkeys!</li> <li>We've also added a command palette, and thus the possibility of hotkeys, for toggling the fold on the current line, as well as swapping lines up and down.</li> <li>And there's now a command available to toggle pinning of a pane as well. So many commands!</li> <li>Vim mode now has a prompt for <code>:</code>, <code>/</code>, and <code>?</code>.</li> <li>Sidebar notes can now be switched between preview and edit using the context menu.</li> <li>Also, we have a Spellchecker now! It's only US/English for now, but at least you can spellcheck <em>a</em> language! Turn this on in Settings =&gt; Editor.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li><code>Select all</code> has been removed from the context menu.</li> <li>Rename now selects the whole file name.</li> <li>We've revamped Automatic update. Now it checks every hour, has a button to check right away, and has a way to disable automatic updates. THIS WON'T WORK FOR NOW on the insider build because it requires a new installer, so this will only be in the public release.</li> <li>We now allow customizing <code>Cmd/Ctrl+K</code>, which was previously reserved for the Markdown editor's insert link.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Search highlighting now shows through code and <code>==</code> highlight.</li> <li>We fixed the misalignment of the images in the dmg in MacOS. We know that was very important to some of you.</li> <li>There was a very weird Javascript bug wherein a file could not be named &quot;Constructor.&quot; You can now name a file &quot;constructor.&quot; Thanks, Javascript.</li> <li>We fixed context menus sometimes getting stuck open.</li> <li>We fixed link and tag autocomplete showing up too far on the left.</li> <li>And we fixed block LaTeX not being recognized without a newline before it.</li> <li>We fixed internal links not working in edit mode when it contains _ or when spellchecker picks up a word.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>We've rebuilt the pane system entirely, adding lots of functionality and flexibility to the way you can interact with your notes:</li> <li>Panes can now be rearranged by dragging the icon in the top left of the pane. Dropping onto each of the four sides of an existing pane creates a horizontal or vertical split, dropping in the center swaps positions.</li> <li>Panes can now be moved to sidebars as well, and sidebars can be repositioned in the same way. A drop onto a the top or bottom of the sidebar will create a vertical split, a drop in the center creates a stack of tabs that can be switched between. (Before you ask, no, you can't easily rearrange tabs yet, we're working on that.)</li> <li>Panes can now be manually linked to another pane using an option in the more options menu (the three dots icon in the top right corner of the pane).</li> <li>You can now open backlinks for a specific file pane in the more options menu, which will be linked to just that file. There's also an option for it in the Command Palette.</li> <li>Depending on your settings, some sidebars may not show up initially in the new panel system (most notably Starred Files). If this happens, just disable and re-enable the plugin and they'll come back.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>We now default to &quot;Readable line length&quot;, so that things are more readable on wide screens. This can be turned off in Settings -&gt; Editor. And, yes, the exact width can be adjusted in custom CSS.</li> <li>The editor has a more noticeable tab delimiter.</li> <li>Contrast in dark mode default CSS has been adjusted for better readability.</li> <li>We had previously tried to add legacy fallback for graph view on older hardware. This time we actually did so.</li> <li>Custom CSS can now be enabled from Appearance tab. Community themes can also be accessed from there directly.</li> <li>We added a search filter on the hotkeys settings tab, because there are now lots of hotkeys.</li> <li>And we added a hotkey to open the help docs, <code>F1</code> by default.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>In Mac OS there was a bug that caused crashes when trying to record audio. We fixed that one, but:</li> <li>IMPORTANT: IF YOU ARE ON MAC OS YOU MUST RE-DOWNLOAD THE DMG INSTALLER for v0.7.0 or later AND RE-INSTALL for this bug to be fixed. If you don't care about audio recording, though, it shouldn't matter, the auto-update will still work. Re-installing will not affect your data in any way though, so there's no reason not to do it.</li> <li>There was a bug where malformed links would cause the app to go blank. Now it just doesn't work, as it shouldn't.</li> <li>A memory leak in graph view has been plugged.</li> <li>We fixed the bug where non-breaking spaces in filenames would cause unpleasant behavior.</li> <li>Relatedly, we fixed the bug where filenames with accented characters and CJK characters were causing trouble on MacOS. In summary: Unicode is weird.</li> </ul> </content>

Previously tags could not start with a digit; now tags can start with a digit but must not be ALL digits (i.e. #365)</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Table justification got broken in 0.6.5 by the html sanitizer, it's not broken anymore.</li> <li>The html sanitizer also broke checkboxes not working in preview mode. We fixed that too.</li> <li>Hover tooltips were sometimes making a white bar show up at the bottom of the page. That should no longer be the case.</li> <li>Links that are <code>[[#section]]</code> will now properly link to headings in the same file. This will also work for <code>[link](#heading)</code>.</li> <li>We fixed a bug where sometimes navigating back wouldn't let you navigate forward again.</li> <li>And we also fixed a thing where navigating back would not save layout when closing/opening the app.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>We added an option for deletions to use either 1) System trash, 2) local vault <code>.trash/</code> or 3) permanent delete like before. This means an extral layer of safety in case you accidentally delete a note. The default is System trash, but if the system trash is disabled, it will use <code>.trash/</code> by default.</li> <li>There are now several options for opening files in new panes! <code>Cmd/Ctrl-click</code> from the file explorer will do it. When using the quick switcher, <code>Cmd/Ctrl-Enter</code>will open the selection in a new pane.</li> <li>Relatedly, the quick switcher can use <code>Shift-Enter</code> to create a new note instead of opening the selected match, if you have names that are too similar. <code>Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-Enter</code> creates and opens in a new pane.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Clicking on search results and backlinks will now stay in preview mode and not force you to edit mode. It will also scroll and highlight in preview mode.</li> <li>We no longer allow choosing an inaccessible folder (like Program Files on Windows, or Applications on MacOS). This should solve a problem some Windows users had with having to run the application as an administrator, and will head off a bunch of other possible problems in the future.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Latex and code highlighting now work for embeds.</li> <li>Regular Markdown internal links are now properly indexed for graph view and backlinks. Renaming files also updates those if found.</li> <li>The Backlinks pane no longer shows empty when closing a pane (it previously should have shown the other pane's backlinks but instead showed nothing).</li> <li>We fixed some weird flicking scroll sync behavior introduced in 0.6.5. Sorry about that.</li> <li>We Fixed pressing Enter on title rename sometimes causing a newline to be entered into the source editor.</li> <li>And we fixed the fact that clicking on some footnotes didn't do anything. It will now navigate as it should have all along.</li> <li>You know the thing where when you renamed a file, another open file with a link to it would not have the link properly updated? That shouldn't happen anymore.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>Due to popular demand, we now have inline latex support! Didn't really expect that to be a popular demand, but, we have it!</li> <li>The Help docs are everywhere now! They're in the Vault chooser! They're in the Settings! They're in the native system menus! And they now have their own button, a question mark next to Settings! This is probably technically under &quot;Changes,&quot; but your docs writer is so excited about this that it goes under &quot;Shiny new things&quot;, sorry devs.</li> <li>We added an option to open in preview mode by default, with a customizable hotkey.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>We made significant speed improvement to file explorer and tag panes. Users with a large number of notes will be most likely to be able to tell the difference, but every little bit helps.</li> <li>There's also been significant speed improvements to large documents opening in preview mode.</li> <li>Help docs now appear in the default directory where applications store data (which varies by OS), not in your vault.</li> <li>Embedded attachment files no longer show up in Graph View. This should make navigating that significantly less noisy.</li> <li>We made a bunch of aesthetic improvements to Graph View. We set a maximum zoom level to avoid blurry text, adjusted the fade amount, and now only apply a color circle when highlighting. The Graph View will also fall back to canvas rendering for older computers.</li> <li>Now when you try to embed PDF, instead of nothing, you see a box with file name, and an icon to open it in your default app.</li> <li>In the Community Themes tab, there's a switch so you can choose to only see themes compatable to the mode you're in.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>We fixed various CSS related bugs where elements would superimpose, or otherwise get stuck on the left-most side of the editor when it's supposed to be indented.</li> <li>We fixed a CSS bug wherein the editor would sometimes not properly render nested styles.</li> <li>And we fixed the CSS so highlighted text in dark mode is no longer black, which was kind of the opposite of highlighting.</li> <li>Also, footnotes now render correctly. And your humble docs writer finally remembered that inline footnotes are a thing, so those are documented now.</li> <li>We fixed a rare issue where typing in nested lists caused linked panes to scroll down as you type.</li> <li>We fixed the Quick Switcher not saving newly opened files in &quot;recents&quot;.</li> <li>We fixed an issue with notes sometimes closing when edited in another program that uses atomic writes. This seemed to most affect vim users, but it should be fixed for everyone.</li> <li>We turned off spellchecker for filenames, because until we get spellchecker everywhere, that was just confusing.</li> <li>Sometimes creating a partial link before another link would cause autocomplete to add gibberish. That should no longer happen.</li> <li>The Home/End keys should go to a wrapped end of a line instead of the full line.</li> <li>Now when switching to preview mode while the link autosuggester is open, the autosuggester will no longer hang around uselessly.</li> <li>Sometimes the tag pane was empty for no reason. Now it will be as lush as it should be.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><p>This is a small release to fix some bugs that made the Graph view unusable.</p> <h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>There is now an &quot;Insider Build&quot; option. If you purchased a Catalyst license (any tier), you have access to early builds. The setting to turn this on is in Settings =&gt; About. Information on Catalyst licenses can be found <a href="https://obsidian.md/pricing">on our website</a>.</li> <li>In the Graph view, hovering an item now shows the note name. This means that even when you zoom way out you can still see which notes are where without being overwhelmed.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>The Graph view will stop rendering when nothing on screen is changing. This probably won't make a difference to most people, but those of us with 2k+ notes will see a performance improvement.</li> <li>The Graph view now also includes embedded links.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>On the open Vault dialogue, deleting a Vault will now delete it, not open it as though to make you feel guilty for wanting to delete it.</li> <li><code>ctrl-b</code> will now no longer step on OS- level movement hotkeys.</li> <li>Sometimes you could click through a note to the Graph view behind. This turns out to be a very counterintuitive way of doing Random Note, and we stopped that from happening.</li> <li>The Graph view would render the names of nodes behind other notes, which made them hard to read. They are now out front where they belong.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>The big news this release: We now support multiple vaults! You can now have windows open to different places, each with their own custom settings and CSS. Details on how to use this feature are in [[Work with multiple vaults]].</li> <li>Now when typing a link, if you press <code>|</code> (that's bar/pipe, not L or 1), it will autocomplete and allow you to start typing display text immediately.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Most of the changes this release are on the back end, working on new features.</li> <li>Because of the new Vault functionality, the dialogue to open new or existing vaults has been moved out of Settings into its own thing just above the Settings button.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>We made a bunch of minor bug fixes and quality of life improvements. Things that were previously subtle or hidden in the interface are now revealed, tastefully. Places text could previously not be selected, are now selectable.

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li>The big news: We've implemented linking to headings! Start typing a link like you would normally. Once you highlight the note you want from the list, press <code>#</code> instead of <code>Enter</code> and you'll see a list of headings in that file. Press <code>#</code> again for each subheading, and <code>Enter</code> to complete the link.</li> <li>Related to that, if you make a link with heading specified for an embed, it will show just that section in preview mode. The hover preview will also show just that section.</li> <li>The OTHER big news: You can now follow links with the keyboard. By default, follow the link under the cursor with <code>alt-Enter</code>, and open in a new panel with <code>Ctrl-alt-Enter</code>, but of course these are customizable in [[Keyboard shortcuts]].</li> <li>You can now now search AND replace, <code>Ctrl+H</code> by default.</li> <li>Daily notes now have the option of using a template note. Set this in the plug-in settings.</li> <li>We also added commands to toggle the left and right side bars. No hotkey set by default.</li> </ul> <h2>Changes</h2> <ul> <li>Link suggestion now has fuzzy search. No more trying to remember what order words came in when you named that file.</li> <li>Both the link suggestion and the quick switcher highlight matches as you type. Yes the colors for these can be changed in CSS.</li> <li>When you use the Navigate Back command to return to a document, we now restore your scroll location and cursor selection.</li> <li>Markdown links with relative paths like <code>[link](../Note.md)</code> now work. The path is relative to the file you're making the link in.</li> <li>Improved the [[Format your notes]] examples to include some of the lesser-used formats to satisfy certain CSS developers who shall remain nameless.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Long note titles are no longer truncated with ellipses, so you can actually see what you're typing when you edit them.</li> <li>Long headings are no longer compressed to unreadable in page preview.</li> <li>Star and Unstar commands are now a single toggle command.</li> <li>We fixed that weird table layout issue that would cause columns to resize poorly.</li> <li>We fixed starred notes not appearing after you delete one of them.</li> <li>In the sidebar, you can now close a removed pane after disabling a plugin.</li> <li>Linking an unlinked file no longer navigates to that file at the same time. If that makes no sense to you, you probably never saw the bug. Don't worry about it, it's fixed now.</li> <li>Graph view now runs a single instance in the background. This means you won't lag out the application by opening it multiple times.</li> </ul> </content>

<content type="html"><h2>Shiny new things</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Open multiple files side by side</strong>. See how you can now work with multiple notes.</li> <li><strong>New Markdown editor</strong>! <ul> <li>You can now use <code>Ctrl+B</code> and <code>Ctrl+I</code> to bold and italicize selected text.</li> <li>List markers (including task list) are created for you when you press <code>Enter</code>.</li> <li>You can now fold headings and lists.</li> <li>Brackets and Markdown syntax are now auto-paired for you.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Sort files</strong> in file explorer. You can sort by both file name and last modified time.</li> <li>Search within file. <code>Ctrl+F</code> to open the search, and use <code>F3</code> to jump to next match, or <code>Shift+F3</code> to the previous match. <code>Esc</code> to exit search.</li> <li>Improved search performance for large vaults. Stress-tested with 10,000 Markdown files.</li> <li><code>Ctrl+Shift+F</code> to jump straight to search. Start typing right away!</li> <li>New plugin: <strong>Zettelkasten prefixer</strong>.</li> <li>New plugin: <strong>Daily notes</strong>.</li> <li>Better onboarding!

Might take some time to get used to -- but we think it's for the better!</p> <ul> <li>By default, the 2-pane preview layout is gone. If you want to restore to that view, <code>Shift+Click</code> the preview button on the title bar. <code>Click</code> will turn the current view into preview.</li> <li>Note title bar is now much smaller, allow you to see more text (and longer titles)! It's especially nice when you work with multiple notes.</li> <li>We removed back and forward navigation buttons now that you can have multiple files open. You can still use the shortcuts (<code>Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+Left/Right</code>) to navigate though.</li> <li>Plugin list is moved into settings. You don't need to access it that often anyway.</li> <li>Action buttons like graph view and quick switcher are moved to the top, leaving only settings at the bottom.</li> </ul> <h2>No longer broken</h2> <ul> <li>Fixed Markdown formatting in task list items will break preview.</li> <li>Fixed nested task lists not working.</li> <li>Fixed cannot delete empty folders.</li> <li>Fixed adding duplicate file extensions (e.g. <code>.png</code> when dropping file into another folder).</li> <li>Fixed a single &quot;#&quot; being recognized as a tag.</li> <li>Subfolder changes are now watched recursively on Linux.</li> <li>Fixed files and folders that start with <code>.</code> were not ignored, e.g. <code>.git</code> or <code>.gitignore</code>.</li> <li>Fixed window size not preserved across sessions.</li> <li>Fixed multiple audio recorder icons appear when you repeatedly enable and disable the plugin.</li> <li>Removed Electron help menu items.</li> </ul> </content>
